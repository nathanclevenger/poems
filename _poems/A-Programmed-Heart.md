# A Programmed Heart

In this digital age,  
We code our lives on a page,  
We type away in endless code,  
Building a world that must unfold.  

But with all our lines of code,  
Do we forget our human ode?  
Do we remember our heart and soul,  
Or let machines take full control?  

A heart that's programmed with precision,  
Meticulously planned, without permission,  
Can it love with the same fervor,  
Or will it stay a passive observer?  

Can we program empathy and kindness,  
Or are these traits exclusive to humankindness?  
Can we teach a machine to care,  
Or is that a human trait, so rare?  

As we build our automated world,  
Let's not forget the love that we hold,  
The passion that drives us to create,  
The spark that makes us human and great.  

For in the end, it's not the code we write,  
Nor the programs that we design,  
It's the love we give and the hearts we touch,  
That truly define our worth, as such.  

So let us not forget our roots,  
Our emotions and our attributes,  
Let us program our hearts with care,  
And build a world that's just and fair.  

For in the end, what truly counts,  
Is the love we share and the bonds we mount,  
So let us code with love and with heart,  
And our digital world will be a work of art.
