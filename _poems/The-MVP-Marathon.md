# The MVP Marathon

The race of startup life,  
Is one that's never slow,  
Every stride a step towards,  
The world you want to grow.  

You start off with an idea,  
A dream inside your mind,  
And soon it becomes clear,  
Your vision is just the kind.  

You gather your team of runners,  
And strap on your running shoes,  
The journey is now upon you,  
Time to win or lose.  

The first step in this marathon,  
Is to find your product's niche,  
Researching your customers' needs,  
Is no easy feat to reach.  

But once you have a solid MVP,  
A prototype that shines,  
It's time to take it to the pitch,  
And see what sparks it finds.  

You venture into the marketplace,  
With confidence and zeal,  
You pitch, you hustle, you pivot,  
Always keeping it real.  

The support you get varies,  
Some interested, some not,  
But you can't get discouraged,  
Just gotta give it a shot.  

As you run your MVP marathon,  
You realize it's not a sprint,  
You need agile methodologies,  
To adapt and make a dent.  

You gather feedback from your users,  
And iterate along the way,  
The key is to stay open-minded,  
And not to get in the fray.  

Along the course you'll come across,  
Hills that are steep and high,  
You gotta keep that MVP running,  
And never say "I'll try".  

Embrace the challenge of the journey,  
Enjoy the sweat and tears,  
Know that you're in it for the long haul,  
It'll take years, not just years.  

Keep your eyes on the horizon,  
Where your vision truly lies,  
Believe in yourself and your team,  
And keep pushing the prize.  

Remember, it's not about the finish line,  
But the journey you undertake,  
And the lessons learned and obstacles overcome,  
That make the MVP so great.  

So keep sprinting towards success,  
And never give up the fight,  
The MVP marathon is yours to run,  
Just do it with all your might.
