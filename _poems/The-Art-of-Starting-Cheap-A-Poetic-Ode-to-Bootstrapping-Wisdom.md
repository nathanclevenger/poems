# The Art of Starting Cheap: A Poetic Ode to Bootstrapping Wisdom

In the world of startups, where dreams are turned to reality,
The art of starting cheap is a cherished mentality.

For those who want to keep their equity,
And build their empire without financial depletion.

Bootstrapping is a way, a path untraveled,
By aspiring entrepreneurs who want to be unraveled.

The wisdom of starting cheap, a trick of the trade,
Allows you to stretch every dollar made.

Start small, take one step at a time,
No need to rush for success, it's a long climb.

With frugality as your guiding light,
You can build your business with all your own might.

No funding, no investors, just your own sweat,
A recipe for success, one you won't forget.

The art of working smart, and using your wits,
To achieve your goals, one bit by bit.

Simplicity reigns supreme, with less you can do more,
With every new venture, you'll grow and explore.

Be creative, be persistent, failure's part of the game,
But with bootstrapping, success can be gained.

The journey may be long, but the reward is sweet,
An empire built from nothing, a feat truly elite.

Bootstrapping may seem hard, but it's a lesson in grit,
In a world of entrepreneurship, where only the strong will fit.

So take heed from this ode, and trust in your plan,
To build your aspirations with your own two hands.

Building a successful startup without vast amounts of cash,
May seem impossible but we all start where we stand.

An entrepreneur of will, with passion for the game,
Is all you need to ignite the bootstrapping flame.

So go forth, courageously, and never forget,
The art of starting cheap, the bootstrapping mindset.
