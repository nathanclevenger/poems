# Passion, Purpose, Perseverance: A Poem on the Virtues of Bootstrapping 

They say that starting up is quite a feat,
For those without funds or a safety net.
But hold your heads up high and do not fret,
For bootstrapping will make the journey sweet.

With passion burning in your hearts so bright,
The spark that started in your mind ignite.
Here is where purpose takes its firm grip tight,
And guides your course both day and night.

Perseverance shows its very face,
As hurdles block your path and slow down pace.
Through mist and fog, with strength and grace,
The goal ahead remains yours to embrace.

With tenacity and resilience so true,
And a steadfast attitude to push on through,
Those cherished moments will come into view,
And the challenges faced will only make you a stronger crew.

The path you walk may not be smooth and straight,
The journey ahead may be a daunting fate.
But remember, fortune doth favor the brave,
And the rewards for bootstrapping are well worth the waive.

For every step you take, there lies a goal,
For every obstacle, there is a role,
And with each success, you will be more whole,
And the strength you gain will help you reach your ultimate goal.

Hold your head up high, dear entrepreneur,
For bootstrapping is what makes you pure.
The journey may be long, but it will endure,
And the happiness you attain, no one can obscure.

The passion burning in your heart,
Along with purpose, will play a vital part,
And with strong perseverance, you will have the art,
To turn your dreams into a successful startup, from the very start.

So, let us raise a toast this day,
To those brave enough to choose the bootstrapping way.
With passion, purpose, and perseverance in sway,
Inspiring many to follow the path, come what may.

In conclusion, dear startup-mate,
The bootstrapping path may seem daunting, but it is not too late.
For passion, purpose, and perseverance will lead the way,
And soon, you will find success in your day-to-day.
