# The Price of Innovation: A Startup Poetry Slam

Innovation comes with a price,
A price not quite so nice,
For entrepreneurs that strive and fight,
To bring their startups into the light. 

The price of innovation can be steep,
As entrepreneurs take the leap,
From concept to product, the journey's long,
And the road is often steep and wrong.

Long hours, endless nights,
Days when things just don't feel right,
But the entrepreneur pushes on,
Making their startup strong.

Investors want to see returns,
Profit margins, and money earned,
But the price of innovation is unclear,
All while the entrepreneur fights for dear.

The price of innovation can't be measured,
It's the soul and the heart that's treasured,
Innovation takes courage, grit, and heart,
Itâ€™s a trait that sets entrepreneurs set apart.

The startup life is full of risks,
And the entrepreneur who takes the risk,
Often pays the highest price,
For the chance to put their dream to life.

The entrepreneur knows the prize,
That innovation brings to their eyes,
The chance to create, to build, to grow,
Their startup becomes the seed to sow.

As the startup grows, so too does the price,
Innovation requires a sacrifice,
A sacrifice of time, of energy, of love,
For the dream the entrepreneur is deprived of.

But in the end, the price is worth it,
For the startup that has hit,
For the entrepreneur that has dared,
To follow their heart and not be scared.

Innovation is the lifeblood of startups,
And the price that's paid for all its ups,
Is the chance to make an impact,
To change the world through its contract.

So let's give thanks to those that dare,
To start a company with love and care,
For they are the ones that pay the price,
To bring innovation to life.
