# The Valuation Tango

In the world of startups, there is a dance
A tango with a special romance
It's not the kind that you might expect
It's all about valuations, it's direct

Investors and founders dance the night away
Moving to the tune of a growing runway
They spin, they twirl, they dip and they sway
Making sure the company is here to stay

The music starts slow, the heartbeats quicken
The founders pitch, and the investors listen
They want to hear about market size and growth
To make sure their investment will lead to both

The founders smile, they've got a great pitch
They say their product is like a magic switch
It solves a problem that no one knew existed
And the market demand is highly persisted

The investors nod, they like what they hear
They ask about the competition, is there any fear?
The founders are confident, they've done their research
They've got a great team, and they're ready to lurch

The music picks up, the dance gets intense
The investors start talking about equity defense
What are the terms, what's your company worth?
These are the questions that are known to unearth

The founders pause, this is a crucial deal
They know they need the cash, but nothing is ideal
They want to keep control, but need the investment
They want a win-win, not another testiment

The investors suggest a number, the founders think it's too low
They suggest a higher one, the investors say, "let's go slow"
The dance continues, the tension is high
It's all about finding a valuation that will satisfy

Finally, they reach an agreement, they've struck a deal
The founders sigh, this has been a big ordeal
But they're excited, they've got the cash they need
Now they can focus on planting their business seed

The dance ends, the company has a new investor
The founders are grateful, they couldn't have done this faster
They know there's still work to do, but they're ready to shine
It's time to build this startup and make it a part of the Divine

So as they walk away, they'll always remember
The valuation tango, the dance of ember
It's not just about getting the money, it's also about the art
Building a successful startup takes both passion and heart.
