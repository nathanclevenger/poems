# Scrimping and Saving: A Poem on Bootstrapping Survival Skills

In the world of startups where dreams are made,
Success is hard to come by, and failure's often paved.
With a path full of hurdles, entrepreneurs lack,
The funds to unlock opportunities, and the value to add.

Money is the lifeline that startups seek,
To fuel their growth, and opportunities to seek.
Yet in the scarcity of resources, the buck stops here,
As entrepreneurs grapple with accumulating capital with fear.

Scrimping and Saving becomes the way of life,
Bootstrapping their way, avoiding the knife.
Of falling into debts, and taking up loans,
That could drown them, leading down unknown roads.

Friends and family could always lend a hand,
But pride, and self-reliance are their command.
Entrepreneurs, self-sufficient, and averse to aid,
Rely on their own smarts to avoid getting waylaid.

With little money to show, and no fancy gear,
Bootstrapped startups plod on, unflinching, with cheer.
They hustle relentlessly, with diligence and grit,
Investing their sweat equity, and exhibiting true grit.

Their mantra is simple, and often heard,
"Make money first before splurging on bespoke shirts."
For scrimping and saving is a habit they breed,
To make every penny count, and eliminate needless feed.

Every resource, every penny is put to work,
Innovating, experimenting, and striving to quirk.
Their products are simple, basic necessities,
That serve their market well, with no redundancies.

Scrimping and Saving becomes their second nature,
A survival toolkit, an essential fixture.
Something that they learn the hard way,
When money's scarce and competition holds sway.

They learn to stretch a dollar over a mile,
Cutting expenses down to the bare minimum, with a smile.
Outsourcing, bartering, and working with thrift,
To stay lean, scrappy, and agile, the most important lift.

Time becomes their ally, instead of their foe,
As they build their business, inch by inch, with a blow.
Every hour counts, every minute is precious,
A strategy that saves them, and makes them flourish.

For scrimping and saving is not just about money,
It's a mindset, a culture, that's not at all funny.
It's about being able to make do and improvise,
And not be weighed down by all kinds of lies.

Bootstrapping startups are a breed of their own,
Scrappy and lean, they see beyond the unknown.
They're not afraid to fail, and they learn from mistakes,
A resilience that they breed with every step they take.

So if you're starting a business, and facing a cash crunch,
Don't despair, or flounder, or drown in a lunch.
Remember this poem, and the lessons it bears,
Scrimping and Saving can help you go up the stairs.

With grit, determination, and a mindset that's tough,
Bootstrapping survival skills won't be enough.
For you'd need all your wits, creativity, and zeal,
To make it big, and conquer the field.

So here's to all you entrepreneurs, with a dream in your hearts,
May your startup soar high, and never fall apart.
With scrimping and saving in your toolkit, and courage that beats,
May you bootstrap your way to glory, with success at your feet!
