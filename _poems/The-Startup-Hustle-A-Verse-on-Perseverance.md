# The Startup Hustle: A Verse on Perseverance 

Oh, the startup hustle is a rocky road,  
A jagged journey to carry such a load.  
The days are long, the nights are longer still,  
But the ones who succeed, they've got the will.  

It starts with an idea, a spark in the mind,  
A concept that's shaped, a product to find.  
A vision that's grand, a new way to exist,  
A solution to a problem that just won't quit.  

With passion and drive, the team comes alive,  
They work through the day, then into the night.  
They write their plans, they test their theories,  
They design their launch, they ignore their queries.  

The early days can be tough, there's no denying,  
When there's no angel investor, no one's buying.   
When sales are slow, growth is stagnant,  
It's enough to make one's spirit flagrant.  

But here, in the midst of this startup strife,  
One must face the facts, and strive for life.  
Learning from one's own mistakes,  
One must keep moving, for heaven's sake.  

For the startup hustle is a marathon,  
Not a sprint, not some fleeting phenomenon.  
It requires grit, determination, and sweat,  
A relentless drive towards success, the sun has to set.  

The victories are small, but they count,  
Those little wins that are paramount.  
A client signed up, a product sold,  
A hurdle passed, a new chapter told.  

The startup hustle is a test of wills,  
It separates the strong from the weak, it chills.  
It's a make or break, sink or swim race,  
But the ones who thrive, they find their place.  

So, hold on tight, dear startup soul,  
For the journey ahead will take its toll.  
But with perseverance, and a heart full of hope,  
You'll make it through, up the entrepreneurial slope.  

Oh, the startup hustle, it's a ride,  
A constant adventure to manage with pride.  
The obstacles are many, but so are the gains,  
And the ones who survive, oh what a tale they'll retain.  

So, if you're embarking on this journey today,  
And the startup hustle is where you play,  
Embrace the lessons, stay the course,  
Persevere, dear soul, you've got this force!
