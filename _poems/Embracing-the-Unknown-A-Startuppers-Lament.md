# Embracing the Unknown: A Startupper's Lament

Oh, the unknown is a fearsome thing  
A source of stress and worry it does bring  
For those seeking to start up something new  
And unsure of the path they should pursue  

The road ahead is dark and unclear  
With twists and turns that could cause fear  
But for those determined to chase their dreams  
It's a challenge worth undertaking, it seems  

The startupper's life is full of risk and reward  
A journey full of obstacles that must be ignored  
For a single misstep could bring it all down  
But with persistence and determination, success can be found  

It's not just the journey that is tough  
But the destination is far from enough  
For once you reach your startup's goal  
The real work begins, that's the true toll  

Building a business takes time and care  
There are no shortcuts, no magic wares  
It's a constant grind, with no end in sight  
A never-ending struggle, day and night  

But for those who dare, the reward is huge  
A chance to change the world, to make a huge dent  
In the lives of others who they can touch  
And leave a lasting legacy as such  

So, embrace the unknown, my fellow startupper  
For the future is but a blank slate of paper  
Waiting for you to write your story  
With a little bit of faith, and a lot of glory  

For every success story, there are a thousand falls  
But it's the ones who keep getting up that make the calls  
So, keep pushing forward, never give up hope  
For the startupper's journey is a long, but rewarding rope  

And when you finally reach your goal  
It won't just be a finish line you'll roll  
It will be the start of a new journey, a higher climb  
Towards a better future, yours and mine  

Embrace the unknown with open arms  
For it's the start of something big, with endless charm  
And though it may seem daunting at first  
Just remember, you are not alone, and you are first  

First in the race of those who dare  
To change the world, to create and share  
First in the hearts of those who'll follow  
For your courage will inspire them, and they'll echo  

Echo your story, your passion, your drive  
For the startupper's life is far more than just to strive  
It's to embrace the unknown, with all its twists and turns  
And to do so together, with all of the lessons learned.
