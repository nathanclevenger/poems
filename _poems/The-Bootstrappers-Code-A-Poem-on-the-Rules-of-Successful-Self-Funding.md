# The Bootstrapper's Code: A Poem on the Rules of Successful Self-Funding

In the world of startups, there's an elite class  
Those who self-fund their dreams, bootstrapping with pizzazz  
They don't rely on loans or outside investment  
Instead, they follow a code, a set of rules with much commitment  

First and foremost, the code demands frugality  
No plush offices or luxuriousality  
Only what's essential, nothing more  
Every penny saved is a penny earned for sure  

The next rule, patience, is a hard one to abide  
Success can't be rushed, there's no shortcut to ride  
Slow and steady wins the race, it's often been said  
So keep chipping away, success will come ahead  

Perseverance, too, is a vital ingredient  
Obstacles will emerge, but it's critical to be persistent  
Don't give up when things get tough  
Keep pushing and hustling, and getting rough  

Next up is resourcefulness, being able to do more  
With less is core for success on this self-funded floor  
Creativity is key, where there's a will, there's a way  
Adapt to change, pivot as needed, and seize the day  

Flexibility is required, change is the only constant  
Be nimble, be adaptable, and not so recalcitrant  
New opportunities and ideas will emerge  
Remain open-minded and agile, and chances rights might you surge  

The bootstrapper's code also stresses customer focus  
To understand their needs, opinions, and their locus  
Customer feedback shapes one's direction  
Their buying patterns the key to long-term retention  

Lastly, the code emphasizes discipline  
For self-funding calls for much self-mastery within  
Time management, goal setting, and strong work ethics too  
Are habits that are essential in growth and revenue accrual  

In conclusion, the bootstrapper's code demands much  
But its rewards are worth it, and so such  
Bootstrapping is a way to build something tangible and real  
Where success is earned, not simply handed with appeal  

So follow the code, it's served bootstrappers well  
These rules of self-funding will guide you through hardship and swell  
Stay true to them, adapt and be patient  
Success will follow, as long as your determination is blatant.
