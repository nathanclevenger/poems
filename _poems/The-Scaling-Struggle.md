# The Scaling Struggle

In the startup world, we all know
The dream of growth that we will sow
Our vision to change the game
And bring success is our aim


The early days, full of hustle
Building products, finding troubles
Disrupting old ways of life
Creating value, ease the strife


With grit and drive we push ahead
Our team, united by a thread
Working day and night, no rest
For our startup, we do our best


The first customers, we finally land
Validation, the road we've planned
Soon we realize, we need to scale
Hiring new people, raising capital


Our growth, a double-edged sword
Challenges are not to be ignored
The bigger we get, the harder the task
Managing teams, and building trust


Our culture, we try to maintain
Not easy, as we expand the domain
Our values, guide our every way
As we navigate the challenges, day by day


Scaling, a never-ending struggle
A balancing act, that takes true muscle
We work hard to stay relevant
As competitors try to circumvent


No guaranteed success, we know too well
Innovation and agility, must always dwell
And when we stumble, we get up
Learning from mistakes, never give up


We stay focused on our mission true
To create value, and bring something new
Our startup, our passion, our life
A true adventure, in which we thrive


The scaling struggle, a lesson taught
Perseverance, the key to all we sought
A journey that requires the heart
And a spirit that will never depart.
