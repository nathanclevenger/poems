# Starting from Scratch: An Epic Poem for Bootstrapping Startups

Listen now and hear my tale  
Of those who start from scratch,  
And rise up strong with will and wail,  
Though odds may seem an impassable match.  

For startups face a massive climb,  
Each one begins with naught but a dream.  
No cash, no staff, no brand to shine,  
Just sweat, hard work, and bursting steam.  

But those who stand to face the dawn  
Are not faint of heart nor faint of will,  
They know it takes more than a pawn  
To train their focus and sharpen their skill.  

Through early morns and late at night,  
They work and toil with strength and might.  
With every hurdle they overcome,  
Their passion grows stronger, like a drum.  

They build their product with care and grace,  
Refine and iterate, till perfection they trace.  
Testing and feedback, they never tire,  
Through each challenge, they rise up higher.  

Bootstrapping is the start-up way,  
For entrepreneurs who want to play  
In this competitive world of business today.  
But they are not alone, each step of the way.  

For like-minded people come together,  
Sharing ideas to make things better.  
Mentors guide them, as they forge ahead,  
Helping them avoid the snares and led.  

They learn to pivot, without a hitch,  
Lessons learned that make them rich.  
For it's not just money that they gain,  
But experience that will pave the way.  

So as they journey through their days,  
Through failures, pivots, and delays,  
Their spirit strengthens, their passion grows,  
And they stand stronger than they ever know.  

Now as I close this epic tale,  
Of startups that started from scratch,  
Take heart and let it never fail,  
You too can rise up with will and wail intact.  

For what seems impossible today,  
Will soon be just a faint memory.  
Stand up and take the challenge to play,  
Starting from scratch, with spirit and tenacity.  

For in the end, it's not the cash or fame,  
That truly makes a startup great.  
It's the journey, the passion, and the game,  
That makes each day feel like an epic fate.  

So let us bootstrappers unite,  
And shine a light into the night.  
With courage, grit, and sheer delight,  
We'll blaze a trail, with all our might.  

Starting from scratch, we'll make our mark,  
For we are the ones who'll leave a spark.  
And as we journey through our epic tale.  
We'll inspire others, and never fail.
