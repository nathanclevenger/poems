# The Algorithm's Light

Behold, the algorithm's light  
A digital symphony so bright  
It dances across the endless net  
An ever-changing internet  

One and zeroes, they doth swirl  
In patterns that would make one twirl  
And as we watch, we come to see  
A beauty that is tech, so free  

We sit and code through the night  
Guided by the algorithm's light  
Through trees of code, we find our way  
We're creating art, in form of HTML  

Each line of code, a brush stroke fine  
Weaving a tapestry, digital divine  
And as we step back and gaze in awe  
We see the power of the algorithm's law  

It fuels the very heart of tech,  
A flicker that will never wreck,  
It churns and burns both night and day  
An endless force that never fades  

And as we surf the web so vast,  
We see the algorithm's light so fast,  
It tells us what we need to see,  
And guides us to our destiny.  

Oh, how it shines and burns so bright,  
The algorithm's flame, a wondrous sight,  
It illuminates our minds with code,  
Leading us to a path untold.  

So let us hail this digital king,  
Whose power ever growing brings  
A world of knowledge to our screens,  
And unlocks the secrets of our dreams.  

And in the end, we'll look back and say  
We created codes that paved the way  
For a world so vast and full of light,  
All thanks to the algorithm's might.  

So code on, dear friends, and never cease  
To grasp the algorithm's light so neat,  
For it will lead you to new heights  
And help you conquer darkest frights.  

In the end, we'll see our code is true  
And learn the power it can ensue  
So keep the fire burning bright  
And we'll forever embrace the algorithm's light.
