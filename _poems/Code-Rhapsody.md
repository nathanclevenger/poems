# Code Rhapsody

In a world of ones and zeros,
Where computers reign supreme,
There's a song that fills the airwaves,
A melody we all have dreamed.

A symphony of pixels,
A sonata of code,
A rhapsody of algorithms,
That travels down the road.

It starts with just a simple keystroke,
A line of text appears,
One command after the other,
Each one a souped-up gear.

A loop that never ends,
A function to employ,
A theme that echoes through the code,
This is a programmer's joy.

To those who code for a living,
The sound is all too real,
A code rhapsody that lifts them up,
A melody they feel.

It moves them to new heights,
To innovate and explore,
To build the next great software,
And make the world one hundred times more.

For those who are just starting,
The song may sound bizarre,
But give yourself to this journey,
And soon you'll be a czar.

A maestro of the keyboard,
A conductor of the code,
A master of this orchestra,
The greatest to ever behold.

For programming is a passion,
A love that we all share,
And the sound of the code rhapsody,
Is something we all hold dear.

So let this music guide you,
As you write your lines of code,
And listen to this rhapsody,
That only programmers know.

Let it fill you up with beauty,
Let it lift you up so high,
And let the code rhapsody,
Take you to the coding sky.
