# Against All Odds: A Poetic Battle Cry for Startups Everywhere

Against all odds we take a stand,  
Startups rise across the land.  
With nothing but a dream in hand,  
We forge ahead, a brand new band.  

We work and strive, we sweat and toil,  
Our future bright, but still unsure.  
We face rejection, fear and spoil,  
Yet still we stand, we’re still secure.  

Some call us crazy, others brave,  
But we know what we’re fighting for.  
Against all odds, we’ll find our way,  
And we’ll succeed all the more.  

From zero to one, to one to two,  
Our startup grows, our team expands.  
Despite the odds, we fight anew,  
We take control, we make our stance.  

We test and pivot, learn and grow,  
Our market fit, we’ll soon know why.  
Through highs and lows, we keep the flow,  
And never give up, we’ll never die.  

For we have vision, heart and will,  
And though at times we may feel small,  
We’ll keep on climbing up the hill,  
And reach for greatness, standing tall.  

So let us battle, fight and strive,  
In this startup life, we shall survive.  
Against all odds, we’ll stay alive,  
And our success, we shall derive.  

To our fellow startups, we say  
Stay strong, stay bold, stay true each day.  
Together we’ll make it, come what may,  
And nothing can stand in our way.  

Against all odds, we’ll rise above,  
And show the world what we’re made of.  
We’ll make our impact, leave our love,  
And soar beyond the skies above.  

So heed our cry, our battle song,  
Let every startup, loud and strong,  
Join hands together, to belong  
And rise against all odds lifelong.  

We’ll make a difference, change the game,  
For startups everywhere, we’ll reclaim  
Our destiny, our rightful fame  
Through heart, hard work and undying flame.  

Against all odds, we’ll stay the course,  
And find success, without remorse.  
Our startup life, is not a force  
To reckon with, but to endorse.  

For only those who dare to dream  
Can make a difference, be supreme.  
So follow your heart, let it beam,  
Against all odds, your startup team.  

In conclusion, we’ll say it clear,  
Against all odds, we have no fear.  
Our startup life, forever dear,  
And our journey, forever here.  

So let us rise, together strong,  
And join the battle, come what may.  
Against all odds, we shall belong,  
In this startup life, we’ll seize the day.
