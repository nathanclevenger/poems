# The Binary Waltz

A dance of ones and zeros  
Moves in rhythm like a flowing stream  
A melody composed of encoded notes,  
Performed with binary machines  

Slow and steady, 0 0,  
The dance begins with a steady beat  
A coded step leading to the next,  
Creating a pattern which is oh-so-neat  

Quick and sharp, 1 1,  
The rhythm shifts to a faster pace   
A burst of energy, a rush of code,  
A waltz that never seems to lose its grace  

0 1, 1 0, the dance goes on  
A back and forth that never ends  
A beautiful symphony of 0s and 1s  
A language that only a machine comprehends  

The Binary Waltz is a world apart  
Where machine and programmer dance as one  
A language born of electronic heart  
And a human's creative touch combined  

As the dance goes on, the code comes to life  
Like a painting that's just been given a soul  
The program runs, mighty and supreme  
A creation of pure code that will never grow old  

And so the waltz ends, but only for now  
For in the machine, the code still flows  
The Binary Waltz, beautiful and proud  
Is a work of art that only a programmer knows  

So let us celebrate this powerful dance,  
A symphony played on circuitry and code  
And as we program our machines to prance  
Let the steps we take forever be bold  

For we are the artists of this Binary Waltz,  
With machines as our canvas, code as our brush  
And as we dance with lightning fast speed,  
We create something beautiful without a single rush.
