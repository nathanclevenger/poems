# The Harmonics of Computing

In the glowing world of digits and code,
A symphony plays, a cosmic ode;
A composition of ones and zeroes,
With a rhythm that only machines know.

The keyboard clicks, the mouse scrolls,
As the orchestra of computing unfolds;
A chorus of beeps and whirrs and hums,
A cacophony that beats like drums.

Circuit boards and silicon chips,
Electronic voices that never slip;
A universe of logic and flow,
Where data streams and algorithms grow.

Binary pulses, a digital dance,
A serenade of pure happenstance;
The language of computers so sublime,
In perfect harmony, each line by line.

For every program, every app,
An intricate melody that sets the trap;
A chorus of voices that work as one,
A song that never can be undone.

The internet, a symphony of sound,
A vast orchestra spanning ground to ground;
A global choir, a magical choir,
Where every voice ignites digital fire.

From the smallest device to the grandest servers,
The symphony echoes, in constant fervor;
A world where computing is the art,
An anthem that plays within each heart.

So let us all celebrate this grand symphony,
Of computing, the language of our destiny;
A melody of perfect harmony,
That never fails to bring us to our knees.
