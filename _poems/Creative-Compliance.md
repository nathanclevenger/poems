# Creative Compliance

In the world of code, there lies a demand  
For strict compliance to a set of rules,  
A discipline that sometimes makes us pained  
But without which, error would be our tool.  

We all know how it is, the endless lines  
Of syntax that must pass the compiler's test,  
The brackets, semicolons, and keywords assigned  
To give our programs their required zest.  

But creative souls may sometimes feel confined  
By rules, believing they impede their art,  
They find it hard to leave their code behind,  
Afraid to break from norms that serve a part.  

Yet true creativity is not opposed  
To form, or to the structures we must heed,  
For rules can be a part of art, exposed  
In algorithms that bring us to a need.  

We must be willing to explore and test,  
To question in our minds each syntax rule,  
To find the ways in which we may invest  
Our talent to produce a program jewel.  

Indeed, the code we write is no mere craft,  
But science, art, and poetry combined,  
And only those who dare to be both daft  
And precise, can an outstanding program find.  

So let us not be held back by the thought  
That rules just limit our creative power,  
For in their form, when cleverly wrought,  
They let our artistry take off like a flower.  

Let us, then, embrace creative compliance,  
A blend of beauty and precision, fused,  
That builds a program with both great reliance  
And art, a masterpiece that is well-used.  

And as we code, let us not forget  
The beauty of the rules that set us free,  
For in their structure, we may find and get  
The art of programming, in harmony.
