# The Code of Startup Ethics: 
## A Poem on Integrity and Responsibility
---
In the world of startups, nothing matters more  
Than upholding ethics that we all uphold and adore   
Integrity and responsibility are the rules we follow  
For a world of technology that’s sustainable and hallow.

We must protect our users’ privacy and data  
Ensuring it’s secure as ironclad as a tundra  
Customer satisfaction is our ultimate goal  
Being transparent with them is our only soul.

We must always respect intellectual property  
It’s the foundation of any innovation or entity  
We mustn’t infringe or copy, but create instead  
Originality and authenticity is the path we tread.

Our code of conduct and values should be crystal clear  
To ensure that honesty and fairness are always near  
We must be accountable for all our mistakes and sins  
And accept that sometimes failure is where wisdom begins.

We must treat our employees like our family  
Give them a space that is free and friendly  
Ensure that their interests and opinions are heard  
And that their contributions are acknowledged and conferred.

We must only use our power to do good in the world  
To help those around us, with kindness unfurled  
We must strive both for profit and the greater good  
And ensure that our actions remain ethical, even if we should.

In the end, ethics are the foundation of our startup’s identity  
Without them, there’s no success or possibility  
So let us always stand tall and with honor,  
And uphold the code of startup ethics as a true entrepreneur.

Let integrity and responsibility be our guiding light  
As we take on this challenging and uncertain plight  
Let us build a world of technology that’s equitable and just  
And thrive as startup founders, as we always must.
