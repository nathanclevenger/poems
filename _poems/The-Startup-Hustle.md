# The Startup Hustle

The startup hustle, it never ends  
It’s an ongoing battle, with many friends  

When you have an idea, that you want to bring to life  
You won’t stop until you’ve given it a strife  

You’ll work long nights, sleepless and drained  
Putting everything on the line, not to be restrained  

The hustle is real, and it won’t take a break  
It’s a journey you chose, but it’s not a piece of cake  

Your focus is to build, to create and to grow  
To take your idea, and make it a flow  

It’s not always easy, there will be times you’ll fail  
Push through, my friend, and set sail  

Take lessons as they come, improve and adapt  
It’s a constant evolution, not something set  

The startup hustle isn’t just about work  
It’s also a lifestyle, and it’s worth  

Connecting with people who share your vision  
Networking and supporting, it’s never a mission  

You’ll find mentors, who have been in your shoes  
And those who will listen, and provide valued views  

It’s important to take care, and not to neglect  
Self-care and balance, don’t let it deflect  

The startup life can take its toll  
But it’s all worth it, when you reach your goal  

The road ahead won’t always be clear  
But don’t let it be driven by fear  

Embrace the unknown, and tackle the task  
Move forward with purpose, there’s no need to ask  

Let your idea drive you, and your passion to inspire  
Take risks when needed, it will take your higher  

The startup hustle, a journey like no other  
An adventure worth sharing, with one another  

So to all the startup hustlers out there  
Keep pushing forward, it’s a journey we’ll share  

The startup life is a rollercoaster ride  
Embrace it all, let nothing hide  

The final destination may not be clear  
But it’s in the journey, when we persevere  

Remember why you started, keep that in mind  
The startup hustle, leave nothing behind.
