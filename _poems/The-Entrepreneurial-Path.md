# The Entrepreneurial Path

The path of an entrepreneur is a winding road,  
With ups and downs, it weighs a heavy load.  
It's not for the faint of heart, nor for the weak,  
It's for those who dare, those who seek.

A startup's life is never easy,  
But it's the risks we take that make it breezy.  
We jump off cliffs, without a net,  
Our vision so clear, our passion set.

To start anew, to make a change,  
To strike out on one's own, to rearrange.  
This road less traveled is wrought with strife,  
But it's the only way, to make a life.

From sunrise to sunset, and all through the night,  
We work and we toil, with all our might.  
Our days are long, our nights are short,  
We eat on the run, we live in airports.

We sacrifice our time, our sanity,  
We chase our dreams, with so much vanity.  
The world may mock and we may fail,  
But we'll dust ourselves off and prevail.

With every setback, we learn and grow,  
Our eyes set forward, our stride in tow.  
We find new ways, to do things better,  
Our aim is simple, to make life more clever.

To solve a problem, to fill a need,  
To change the world, with blistering speed.  
Our passion drives us, to make a difference,  
We take no prisoners, in our persistence.

With every dollar that we earn,  
We reinvest, to keep our fire burning.  
Our startup grows, with every day,  
Our vision's true, it's here to stay.

The entrepreneurial path is not for all,  
It's for those who hear the startup call.  
It takes grit, determination, and heart,  
To make it work, to do our part.

So, fellow entrepreneurs, let's take the leap,  
Let's stay the course and forge ahead deep.  
For on this journey, we'll find our way,  
And together, we'll make our dreams come what may.
