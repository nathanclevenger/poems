# Making Do with Less: A Verse on the Power of Bootstrapping

In the world of startups, 
bootstrapping is the word,
It's a way to pave the path,
With its very own accord.

It's a method of making do,
With less than what is asked,
It's a mindset of abundance,
Where opportunities are masked.

Bootstrapping is a choice,
That is made with firm resolve,
It's a way to make it work,
With grit and strength to solve.

It's a power that can't be bought,
Or found with a magic wand,
It's a way to push yourself,
In pursuit of your startup bond.

Bootstrapping is a journey,
That takes a lot of sweat and tears,
But it's the best way to succeed,
In the ever-changing startup sphere.

It's a road less traveled,
But it's worth the effort and pain,
For the lessons you will learn,
And the glory you will regain.

So if you're starting up,
And you're short on funding too,
Don't fret, just power through,
And make bootstrapping your go-to.

Remember it's not about the cash,
Or resources you can claim,
It's about the sweat you shed,
And the glory you can aim.

In this world of startups,
Where challenges abound,
Bootstrapping is the secret,
To stay firm on the ground.

So go on, take the leap,
That bootstrapping demands,
And make your startup soar,
With your two feet on the ground.

For your passion and your grit,
Combined with bootstrapping will,
Will take you to new heights,
Of success that will thrill.

So don't let lack of cash,
Bring you down or make you quit,
Just stay the course and push forward,
And see your dreams come to fruition.

For in this journey of bootstrapping,
You'll find the power within,
To make your startup succeed,
And come out shining like a king.

So here's to the power of bootstrapping,
And the spirit it instills,
In all of us who believe,
That with less, we can still fulfill.
