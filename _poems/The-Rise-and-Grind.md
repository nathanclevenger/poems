# The Rise and Grind

Wake up, it’s time to rise and grind
Start your day with purpose in mind
For startup life demands your best
A constant hustle, let’s put it to the test

From dawn till dusk, the grind never stops
For entrepreneurs, time is always of the essence, no time for rest stops
The journey may be tough and long
But it’s the journey that makes you strong

The early morning silence is all too telling
The calm before the storm we know too well in this dwelling
The day ahead with possibilities untold
An adventure awaits, let’s be bold

With a cup of coffee and a clear mind
Let’s conquer the world, vision on our grind
The risks we take, the dreams we chase
United by passion, all for the startup race

There will be failures and setbacks, but let’s not give in
For persistence is key, let’s strive to win
Hold on to that vision, never lose sight
For the world is ours, let’s ignite the light

Amidst the chaos, let’s not forget
To show gratitude, and not just debt
To mentors and team, the support we tend
A collective effort on this startup blend

The road ahead may be steep and rough
But we know resilience, we have enough
With each step forward, let’s cheer and celebrate
For it’s the small wins that make the big great

The startup life is not just about work
But to find joy, moments to lurk
The little things that make us smile
The moments that make it all worth while

The Rise and Grind is not just about the grind
But the journey, the moments, the rewind
Of every challenge, every milestone
The experiences that make us grown

So keep on grinding, keep on pushing
The startup life is always worth choosing
The difference we make, the impact we leave behind
The Rise and Grind, let’s keep it in mind.
