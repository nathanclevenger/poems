# The Art of the Deal: A Limerick on Negotiation

In the world of startups, they say,
Negotiation is key every day;
Youâ€™ve got to be shrewd,
Or your deals will be screwed,
And your business will soon fade away.

To negotiate, you must be bold,
But don't come across as too cold;
Be persuasive, not rude,
Or they'll leave in a mood,
And your haggling will all be for naught.

It's important to know your worth,
And what your company brings to the earth;
Don't undersell yourself,
Or you'll leave on the shelf,
With profits that don't match your hard work.

But it's not just about what you can get,
Good negotiations are a safe bet;
You need to find the sweet spot,
Where both parties have got,
A win that they will not forget.

So to start, you must do your research,
Find out what the other side might beseech;
What do they want out of the deal,
And how can you make it real,
While still getting what you need to reach?

Then you need to set your goals,
And know where your limits do unfold;
Don't start at your max,
Or they'll see you as lax,
And your deal will be left in the cold.

When it's time to enter the room,
Make sure you're prepared for the impending boom;
Be confident and firm,
And know when to confirm,
That the other side wants to consume.

But remember, it's not just about the dough,
It's about the relationship that can grow;
If you leave them feeling slighted,
By your tactics that have collisioned,
It's unlikely they'll want to come back and bestow.

So when negotiations come to a close,
And each party can finally repose;
Make sure everyone is pleased,
And their expectations are released,
And you'll all be happy all the way to your toes.

In the end, negotiation is an art,
So don't let it tear you apart;
Know what you want to achieve,
And let your charisma and wits weave,
A deal that will make you a startup star.
