# Seed Round Blues: A Lyrical Look at Funding Woes

I've got these seed round blues  
And I don't know what to do  
My startup's in its early days  
And we need some cash to get through  

We've got a killer idea  
A product no one's seen before  
But investors don't seem interested  
And we're feeling pretty sore  

It's a tough game to get in  
And an even tougher one to win  
Funding rounds and meetings galore  
It's hard to keep pushing through and succumbing to the draw  

But still we persevere  
Putting in the hours and the work  
Crafting pitch after pitch  
Hoping one of them will perk  

We're out here trying to disrupt  
An industry that doesn't wait  
But without that seed round capital  
We're doomed to meet our fate  

It's frustrating and it's hard  
To know you have what it takes  
But without some initial backing  
Our startup will never take shape  

Our competitors are well-funded  
With backing left and right  
We know we can do it better  
If we could just get our funding right  

We've got a solid team at our core  
All experts in our field  
We've got the drive and the passion  
And the will to never yield  

So we'll keep on fighting  
Until we get our seed round win  
We'll make it happen on our own  
And let our success speak again  

Seed round blues, they're hard to shake  
But we won't let them keep us down  
We'll keep pushing 'til we break through  
And make our startup renowned.
