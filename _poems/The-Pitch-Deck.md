# The Pitch Deck

In the world of startups,  
Pitching is an art.  
If you want to impress VCs,  
Then you'll need to play your part.  

The pitch deck is your canvas,  
Where you paint your vision bright.  
You'll need to give your best,  
To win the investor's sight.  

The first slide's your introduction,  
Make it snappy and concise.  
Capture their attention quick,  
Don't make them think twice.  

Describe the problem you're solving,  
And why it's so urgent.  
Make it sound like the end of the world,  
If it remains unperturbed.  

Once you've got their attention,  
The next slide should be your team.  
Investors bet on people,  
Not just a start-up dream.  

Highlight your past successes,  
Your expertise, your flair.  
Let them know you're the best,  
That you're going somewhere.  

Now, show them your business model,  
Let them see how you'll make cash.  
Be clear, be innovative,  
Show them something that might make a splash.  

Show off your product,  
Make it truly exceptional.  
And if you've got traction,  
Let them know it, be exceptional.  

Now, talk to them about market size,  
Address the elephant in the room.  
Tell them it's a big opportunity,  
And explain your growth to the moon.  

Now, it's time for your ask,  
Be clear and precise.  
Tell them what you need,  
And give them some advice.  

Now, show them the exit,  
This is where they get excited.  
Make them see the potential,  
And why they should be delighted.  

Finally, end with a bang,  
And ask them for some time.  
To show them more in person,  
And make them committed, surely enshrined.  

The pitch deck is your bible,  
Your key to funding, it's clear.  
Make sure it's clear, concise,  
And the investors' expectations you steer.  

The world of startups is tough,  
But with your pitch deck in hand.  
You can win the hearts of investors,  
And bring success to your land.
