# The Co-Founder Contract

There's a certain thrill in starting a business,
The rush of creating something new,
But it's not wise to act too cavalier,
In such a venture there's much to consider.

One of the most important, without a doubt,
Is thinking about your co-founder's role,
And how best to come to an agreement,
To ensure problems don't take their toll.

Do you want a partner, someone with a stake?
Or an employee, with stock options in place?
What about vesting, and how much each should own?
All these factors must be laid out before you commence to grow.

A co-founder agreement is what you need,
To put all these details in black and white,
Such a document can help avoid disaster,
By outlining expectations in plain sight.

The roles are clear when the contract is signed,
The equity split is done upfront,
And your vision can move forward unencumbered,
Without worrying about a partner who's being abrupt.

The agreement should lay out termination,
What happens if one of you wants to leave,
How their stake will be valued and transferred,
To avoid any potential grief.

It should cover the sensitive topic of IP,
Intellectual property rights of the co-founders,
Ensuring these remain with the company,
Long after they part ways and no longer work together.

What about salaries and compensation,
Should they be the same or different?
All of these details can be decided,
And disagreements in the future prevented.

The co-founder agreement is not just about legal,
It's about communication and trust,
The willingness to be transparent,
And being upfront, honest and just.

When forming a startup, there's much on the line,
Time, money, and energy galore,
But if you have a solid co-founder agreement,
You can find peace and stability all the more.

Don't be hesitant to have tough conversations,
And spend time hammering out details,
For in the end, you'll be grateful,
And your business will be better off as it sails.

So don't delay, create a co-founder agreement,
Next time you're starting your own business,
It is a necessary and vital step,
To ensure your venture finds success with a viriness.
