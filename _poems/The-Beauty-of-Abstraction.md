# The Beauty of Abstraction

The world of coding may seem abstract
Full of logic, rules, and syntax intact
With lines of code so cryptic and dense
It's easy to get lost in the pretense

But within this system of pure abstraction
Lies a beauty that defies mere explanation
For every code block and algorithmic flow
Lies a hidden world we cannot yet know

We craft these lines with such precision
Each one a key to unlock our vision
To create software, sites, and games
That bring our dreams to living frames

OOP, ADS, MVC, and more
Each an abstraction that we can adore
Decoupling layers to simplify our work
Abstracting parts that we need not lurk

To build and tinker in such a fashion
Is a joy that fuels our every passion
To see our programs run and thrive
Is what pushes us to code and strive

For in this digital realm we call our own
Lies a kingdom that can be our throne
Where the code we write can change the world
And in our hearts, true happiness unfurled

So let us celebrate this beauty of abstraction
And revel in its creative satisfaction
For with each line of code we write
We craft a world with our own light

And though it may seem abstract and cold
The beauty we see will never grow old
For within this world of code and dream
We find the beauty that makes us gleam
