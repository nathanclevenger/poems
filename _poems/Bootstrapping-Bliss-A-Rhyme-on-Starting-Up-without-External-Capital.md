# Bootstrapping Bliss: A Rhyme on Starting Up without External Capital

From the moment of inception,  
A startup faces a crucial decision.  
Will it seek external capital with precision,  
Or will it bootstrap with unwavering vision?  

For those who choose the latter,  
Bootstrapping becomes a daily matter.  
A dance of balancing resources and demands,  
A symphony of frugality and quick-to-hands.  

Oh, bootstrapping may not be easy,  
But the rewards are often quite breezy.  
You retain more control, profits and autonomy,  
And your company grows in a stable economy.  

When you bootstrap, you learn to hustle,  
You become resourceful and agile like a muscle.  
You find creative ways to make things work,  
And never let financing setbacks make you calm or murk.  

It's true that bootstrapping takes longer,  
But with patience and unwavering vigor,  
You can reach your goals and scale higher.  
Without external capital or investor.  

So let's dedicate our skills,  
Our minds and hearts to build  
A business that's resilient and lean,  
Where bootstrapping is the king and queen.  

Let's think outside the box,  
And create products and services that rock.  
Let's iterate, pivot and test,  
And never give up on our quest.  

For in the end, bootstrapping bliss  
Is more than just a sustainable business.  
It's a lifestyle, a mindset, a creed,  
A way to succeed without external greed.  

So let's raise our glasses to bootstrapping,  
To those who choose it with unwavering backing.  
May your companies grow and prosper,  
And may bootstrapping forever be your answer.
