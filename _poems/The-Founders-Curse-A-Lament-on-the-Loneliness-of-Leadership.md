# The Founder's Curse: A Lament on the Loneliness of Leadership

It begins with a spark of an idea  
A dream that sets your heart ablaze  
A passion that drives you forward  
And launches you into the startup craze  

You wake up early and work late  
Putting in more than anyone could know  
Creating something from nothing  
A labor of love that constantly grows  

But there's a curse that comes with founding  
A weight that only leaders must bear  
The loneliness of carrying responsibility  
For every triumph, failure, and care  

There are days when the mountain looms  
Uncrossable, daunting, and high  
When you wonder if it's all worth it  
And if you were sane to even try  

The doubt that creeps in slowly  
Like a vine that twists and winds  
Chokes out the passion you once had  
And leaves you feeling confined  

You'll hear words of reassurance  
From those you've gathered around  
But sometimes it feels like there's no one  
Who understands the struggles that abound  

The responsibility can be suffocating  
As you lead your team through the fray  
And the weight of every decision  
Can leave you feeling lost in the fray  

It can be hard to keep perspective  
When the stakes are constantly raised  
And success can come at a great cost  
But failure only adds to the malaise  

And yet, among the turmoil and struggle  
There are moments of brilliant grace  
When a team member steps up valiantly  
Or an investor backs you with eager pace  

When it all comes together seamlessly  
And the momentum carries you by  
The rush of possibility is overwhelming  
And the curse seems momentarily shy  

But as a founder, you know better  
Than to let your guard slip for long  
For the curse is always waiting nearby  
To bear down with its crushing song  

So take heart, intrepid entrepreneur  
For though the curse is real and deep  
You've got the grit and drive to make it  
And your loneliness is shared by those who dare to leap  

You are a member of a tribe of founders  
Who understand all that you juggle  
Together, you can weather the curse  
And turn your startup into a healthy, thriving struggle  

For though the weight may be great  
And the path may lead astray  
You've got the fire that makes you great  
And the strength to pave the way.
