# Breaking Through the Noise

Out here in the startup world,  
The noise can be so loud  
The constant chatter and commotion  
Can disorient like a cloud  

The competition is fierce,  
Everyone is trying to be heard  
With so many voices vying for attention  
It's hard to distinguish a word  

But there are those who rise above,  
Who are able to break through  
They're the ones who capture our attention  
And bring their ideas into view  

They're the entrepreneurs, the dreamers,  
The ones with a vision so clear  
Their message cuts through the noise  
And resonates far and near  

They start with an idea, a spark,  
And turn it into a flame  
They work tirelessly day and night  
And all their efforts they proclaim  

They build their teams and their networks,  
They hustle and they grind  
They create something out of nothing  
And they leave their rivals behind  

And when they finally break through,  
When they've risen above the din  
They inspire others to do the same  
And that's where the magic begins  

For startup life is hard, it's a struggle,  
It's an uphill climb that never ends  
But those who persevere and stay the course  
Are the ones who will be legends  

So let us all take inspiration  
From those who've gone before  
Who broke through the noise and made their mark  
And opened up new doors  

Let's join the ranks of the startup warriors  
And endeavor to make a change  
Let's break through the noise and be heard  
And shake up the status quo range  

For in the end it's not the noise  
That matters, nor the roar  
It's the message that we're trying to share  
That counts forevermore.
