# The Code of the Future

In lines of code, we find our fate  
A world of data we create  
We build and innovate to no end  
Our minds to technology, we lend  

With each keystroke, we unlock doors  
Create solutions, and so much more  
We build systems to change the world  
Our imagination unfurled  

As we code, we build a bridge  
From the present to futures image  
We create the foundations of tomorrow  
The promise of a better world, we bestow  

We are the ones who make things move  
Our intelligence, the codes prove  
In front of screens, we write and learn  
Coding, our passion, forever to burn  

Our paths, winding to a better way  
Our purpose to create a brighter day  
Algorithms flow through our veins  
Code, our strength and what sustains  

We enter a world of possibilities  
Where technology fuels our abilities  
We evolve with every byte and node  
Bringing humanity to the future mode  

The code of the future, a new state  
A world of technology, we create  
We write the foundations of digital art  
And from that, a new era we start  

Artificial intelligence now in view  
New horizons present themselves anew  
We write new data streams each day  
Creating a smarter, brighter way  

With our tech, we improve each life  
Enabling us to overcome each strife  
The code of the future lays the groundwork  
For a world of endless possibilities unbound  

We code to create a better world  
An ever-evolving future, unfurled  
A world where limits do not exist  
A world of code with an eternal twist  

As we move forward, we build anew  
Our creations shaped the world through and through  
The future is just a few keystrokes away  
Our code, the guide that forever stays  

In lines of code, the world unfolds  
Our destiny lies in what we hold  
Minds sharp, fingers poised to write  
The code of the future is always upright.
