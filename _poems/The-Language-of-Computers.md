# The Language of Computers

In the world of coding, we speak
A different tongue, not human-speak.
A language born from logic’s grace,
A code that powers every space.

From lines of text to pixels bright,
Computers speak with gleaming might.
Commands complex and concise too,
A universe of things to do.

The language of computers flows,
In zeroes and ones it proudly shows.
It casts a spell of wond’rous hues,
In worlds of code that we peruse.

From bytes and scripts to databases,
Each file and key unlocks the cases.
The code we write, a noble deed,
In programming, we lead the creed.

The languages, they come and go,
From C to Python, new ones grow.
The syntax changes, sure and fine,
Innovation drives the code design.

But some things stay, a constant truth,
The binaries we give in youth,
A handshake with the machine,
In zeroes and ones, we intervene.

And so we code, with passion great,
From desktops to the cloud’s estate.
We build the apps that mark our time,
In code’s embrace, we climb and climb.

The language of computers speaks,
A dialect that never sleeps.
It tells the tales of zeroes true,
In ones that never misconstrue.

The codes we write, a language grand,
A symphony conducted by hand.
A robot dance of ones and zeroes,
In a language bound to the code’s Free flows.

And yet, the code we write so cold,
A beauty, still it does unfold.
From function calls to templates fair,
A language built beyond compare.

In code we trust, our voice we share,
Millions of lines, we plan and bear.
A language spoke, loud and clear,
In endless loops, we have no fear.

The language of computers speaks,
A song that never hesitates or leaks.
From algorithms to swift routines,
A language that echoes in our dreams.

So let us code, with hearts well set,
And never fear, nor ever fret.
The language of computers sings,
In bits and bytes, the world it rings.
