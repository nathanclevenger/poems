# Never Enough Time

Time, oh time, elusive friend
We chase your seconds, minutes, and hours without end
In a startup life, it seems there's never enough
Our to-do lists grow long and our days become tough

We wake up early and stay up late
Trying to fit in all the tasks on our plate
From product development to investor meetings
Our calendar's full and our minds start to fleeting

In the midst of the chaos, we often forget
To take a breath, to pause, to reset
To reflect on our progress and all we've achieved
To be grateful for the moments that we've received

But time marches on, never stopping for us
And the pressures of the startup life – they can be rough
We're constantly striving for more success
And the fear of failure is a constant stress

We wonder if we're making the right choices
If we're listening to the right voices
If we're moving in the right direction
If we have enough time for reflection

But in the hustle and bustle, we must remind
Ourselves that time, indeed, can be kind
It's a precious gift, a limited resource
Something that we must use with great force

We must be intentional, deliberate, and wise
With how we manage our time – it's the ultimate prize
We must prioritize and focus on what truly matters
And let go of the rest, the noise, and the clatters

We must invest in ourselves and our well-being
In our relationships, our passions, our dreaming
We must take breaks, vacations, and rest
To fuel ourselves so we can be our best

We must acknowledge that time is not infinite
That there will be moments when we feel limited
That we must make choices with our eyes wide open
And embrace the journey, even when it's broken

For in the startup life, there will always be
Challenges, setbacks, and uncertainty
But the beauty of the journey lies in the climb
And the way we use our time – it's the ultimate sign

So let us be mindful of our choices and our pace
And let us not forget the power of grace
Let us be grateful for each moment we're given
And use our time to create a life worth living.

Time, oh time, elusive friend
We'll never fully understand your bends
But in the startup life, one thing is clear
Our time is precious – let's use it with care.
