# Startup Ethics: A Moralistic Look at Entrepreneurship

In the world of startups,  
where fortunes are made and lost,  
There exists a code of ethics,  
A moral compass, at what cost?  

The drive for profit can be all-consuming,  
As founders chase the golden prize,  
But what of those left behind,  
In the struggle to rise and rise?  

For every unicorn startup,  
There are countless others that fail,  
Leaving destruction and heartbreak,  
In their wake, a dismal tale.  

So is it worth pushing onward,  
With a product that may not succeed?  
Is there a moral responsibility,  
To consider the impact and indeed,  

The effect on society, employees,  
And the environment we all share?  
Should entrepreneurs keep in mind  
That their actions have weight and bear  

Consequences that ripple outwards,  
Far beyond the realms of profit alone?  
Is there a case to be made for ethics,  
In the world of startups, yet unknown?  

Perhaps it's time for a new way,  
To explore entrepreneurship's space,  
To place ethics at the core of the mission,  
And let morality have a bigger place.  

Let us not be blinded by the promise  
Of wealth, fame, and glory untold,  
But instead, let us strive for a new future,  
One where success isn't just measured in gold.  

Let us build our startups with purpose,  
And give back more than we take,  
For it is in these ethical actions,  
That true success for all can be made.  

Let us not forget our responsibility,  
To those who trust us with their time,  
To our customers, employees, and society,  
Who will judge us on our deeds, not just our rhymes.  

Startup ethics may seem like a burden,  
A weight that slows us down,  
But it is, in reality, our greatest asset,  
A way to build trust and gain renown.  

So let's embrace this new way forward,  
And set a new standard for our age,  
One where entrepreneurship means more,  
Than just filling up our bank account's page.  

Let's create a world of startups,  
That uphold the highest of moral code,  
Setting a shining example of what's possible,  
When ethical actions lead the road.  

For in the end, it's not just about profit,  
Or being the next big industry influencer,  
It's about creating a better world  
Where startups hold true to their venture. 

So take this to heart, all founders,  
As you build your companies from the ground,  
Remember the importance of ethics,  
And let your moral compass be unwavering and unbound.
