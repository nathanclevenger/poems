# From the Basement to the Boardroom: A Poem on Bootstrapping Ascent

From the basement to the boardroom,  
The journey begins as a dream,  
A spark of inspiration,  
Sets ablaze the flames of a scheme.  

With no investors to back you,  
And no funds to help you start,  
You set forth on a quest,  
To build a business from your heart.  

Bootstrapped and determined,  
You take small steps every day,  
Building your company up,  
In your own resourceful way.  

You hustle and work hard,  
Learning every skill you need,  
Assembling a team of believers,  
Who share in your seed.  

With sweat equity invested,  
And a clear vision in sight,  
You persevere through each obstacle,  
And celebrate each small win with delight.  

The road is not easy,  
And the climb can be steep,  
But with every stride forward,  
Your success starts to seep.  

Your customers become loyal,  
And your revenue streams in,  
As your brand gains traction,  
And your message rises to win.  

Soon you're expanding,  
And your team starts to grow,  
Taking your startup to new heights,  
As your potential starts to show.  

From the basement to the boardroom,  
Your journey has been profound,  
Transforming an idea to reality,  
Through grit, resilience, and unbound.  

So keep charging forward,  
And never lose sight of the goal,  
For from the basement to the boardroom,  
Bootstrapping ascent tells the story of your soul.
