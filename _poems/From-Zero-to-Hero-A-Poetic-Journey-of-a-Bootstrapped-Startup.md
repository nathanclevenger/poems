# From Zero to Hero: A Poetic Journey of a Bootstrapped Startup

In a world of tech, where big bucks prevail,
A startup begins, with a dream to scale,
It’s bootstrapped to start, with a passionate team,
Their hearts full of fire, their minds full of scheme.

They work day and night, with limited cash,
Their priority clear, their focus won’t clash,
They’re building something new, something quite grand,
Their vision is sharp, their execution well planned.

In the beginning, it’s just a few,
A product to validate, experiments to do,
Their passion is high, their hopes higher still,
They believe in their product, they’ve got the will.

The road is bumpy, obstacles abound,
But they keep pushing, their feet on the ground,
They learn from the failures, they pivot with speed,
Their trust in their product, is all they need.

Days and weeks turn to months and years,
The startup grows, with blood, sweat, and tears,
Their customer base strong, their revenue stream clear,
Their product is something, that people hold dear.

From zero to hero, their journey unfolds,
Their story is one, that deserves to be told,
They built something great, with nothing but grit,
Their bootstrapped startup, a tale that won’t quit.

They triumphed over naysayers, they conquered their fears,
They never gave up, they persevered through the years,
Their success is not measured, in money alone,
It’s the impact they’ve made, that has really shown.

They’ve changed the world, in ways beyond measure,
Their bootstrapped startup, a labor of treasure,
They’ve inspired others, to follow their path,
To bootstrap their startups, and make their own math.

In a world of tech, where big bucks prevail,
The bootstrapped startup, has a story to tell,
It’s a story of passion, of grit and of might,
It’s a story that inspires, to reach for new heights.

So if you’re starting out, with nothing but your dream,
With passion in your heart, and a laser sharp beam,
Keep pushing, keep hustling, your time will come too,
And you too, will go from zero to hero, it’s true.
