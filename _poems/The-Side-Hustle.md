# The Side Hustle

In this fast-paced life where we all strive,
To make a mark that's worth the drive,
We often find ourselves in a struggle,
A constant effort to make ends juggle.

But there's a way to make it through,
A path that's often tried and true,
A method to keep things in the flow,
And give your dreams a little glow.

The side hustle is what it's called,
A means to keep the money lured,
A venture that runs alongside,
A life that you can still decide.

It's not just about the extra cash,
It's a way to keep your skills in a dash,
To learn and grow, and test your fate,
To be your own boss, and create.

You see, the side hustle is an art,
A blend of passion, work, and heart,
A way to do what you love to do,
And make a living out of it too.

It's not an easy journey, this I know,
It takes a lot of grit and a can-do,
A willingness to put in the work,
And sometimes venture into the murk.

But it's also a path of great reward,
A chance to shine and get more adored,
To build a brand that stands the test,
And gives your life a little zest.

The side hustle is a startup game,
A way to build your own, and make it tame,
To take control of your destiny,
And give your life more than monotony.

It's not for everyone, that's for sure,
But for those who dare to venture more,
The side hustle can be a shining light,
That makes their lives more bright.

So, my friends, take heed of this call,
And give the side hustle a shot at all,
Who knows? It may be the thing you need,
To fulfill your dreams, and succeed.
