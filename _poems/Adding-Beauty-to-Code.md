# Adding Beauty to Code

Code, art in motion,
Commands that dance in motion,
Craftsmanship in language,
A symphony of devotion.

Syntax with its rules,
Patterns woven with delight,
Logic with its rhythm,
Beauty in code's foresight.

Function by function,
Structure with sense,
An ode to perfection,
A programmer's recompense.

Indents neat and clean,
Whitespace so precise,
Formatting like a dream,
It's what makes code so nice.

Tabs and spaces,
A debate as old as time,
But beauty in code's faces,
Unites even the most chime.

Colors to the rescue,
Syntax highlighting its aid,
Filling life with hues,
A sight never to fade.

Comments with their power,
Stories of code well told,
Bringing purpose to the hour,
A beauty that never grows old.

Version control in action,
A melody of change,
Git's composition,
A masterpiece so strange.

Testing with care,
A symphony of checks,
Ensuring code is fair,
From bugs and errors in wrecks.

Documentation like a poem,
A tale of code's journey,
A testament to home,
And a programmer's tourney.

Design patterns like brushstrokes,
Inheritances, polymorphism,
Objects like canvases of strokes,
Beauty in code's optimism.

Code, the art of expression,
A marvel in its creation,
A celebration of precision,
Adding beauty to its notion.
