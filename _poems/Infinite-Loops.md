# Infinite Loops

The lines of code, they dance and glow
Infinite loops, they come and go
A world of logic, pure and true
The universe of the coder's view

A single keystroke, a change in fate
A careful thought, the system awaits
A letter, a semicolon, a curly brace
A symphony of code, a work of grace

The loops continue, never to end
A cycle of instructions to befriend
A programmer's world, forever to blend
With logic, with algorithms, with no amend

An endless cycle, a never-ending chain
A puzzle, a riddle that never ceases to strain
A world of creation, a place of no restrain
A programmer's universe, a world of no disdain

The mind of a coder, a place of wonder
A place of passion, of skills and thunder
A master of logic, a world of plunder
A place of creation, a place of no blunder

And so the loops continue, forever to run
A symphony of code, a world of fun
A place of creation, a place of none
A world of the coder, forever won. 

The end is never near, always to prolong
A loop of loops, a place of belong
A world of wonder, a place to throng
A programmer's world, always strong

Infinite loops, a place of no bends
A cycle of code, a world that never ends
A place of creation, a place of amends
A world of the coder, forever to ascend. 

So let the loops continue, forever to flow
A world of creation, a place to show
A place of logic, a place to grow
A universe of code, forever to glow.
