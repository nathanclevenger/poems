# Daring to Dream on a Dime: A Poem on Bootstrapping Creativity 

On a dime I dreamt it all
A startup from my humble hall
With little money, but big ideas
I set out to conquer all my fears

I knew it wouldn't be easy
But I set out to see it through
I rolled up my sleeves and got to work
And put my creativity to use

I brainstormed, I planned, I strategized
But most importantly, I dared to dream
I dreamt of a world where my ideas would take flight
And my startup would reign supreme

For every challenge I faced on my journey
I found a way to overcome
I stretched my resources as far as they'd go
And found solutions that could be done

I bartered and traded with others like me
Who had big dreams and small budgets too
We worked together to help each other
And build something that was entirely new

I learned to hustle, I learned to grind
And I found a way to make it all work
With sheer determination, guts, and heart
I made my dreams come to life, without a smirk

And when I stumbled, I got back up
And kept on moving forward still
I knew that giving up was not an option
And my dream was worth fulfilling

My startup grew and flourished
And it became everything I hoped it would be
All because I dared to dream on a dime
And put my creativity to use, boldly and free

So to all the bootstrappers out there
Who are daring to dream on a dime
Know that your ideas are worth fighting for
And your creativity can help you to shine

Use what you have, make it work
And never let a lack of resources hold you back
For with hard work, determination and a dream
You can conquer all that life can stack

So go forth and make your startup a reality
Use your creativity as your guide
For there is nothing that you cannot achieve
If you dare to dream, and never hide.
