# Starting Up with Scratch: A Poem on the Art of Bootstrapping

Starting up with scratch is hard,
It takes courage, grit, and some playing of cards.
The road ahead is windy and unclear,
But if you believe, success is near.

Bootstrapping is an art, a precious skill,
It means creating something from nothing until
Your vision becomes a reality,
Driven by sheer passion and tenacity.

You'll have to pull yourself up by the bootstraps,
Your own resources, and elbow grease.
This journey's not for the faint-hearted,
But it's for those who want to make their way, started.

The road will surely have its bumps and bruises,
But never lose sight of your goals and your muses.
When everything seems to fall apart,
Stay true to your vision, and don't lose heart.

Lean and mean is the way you'll need to be,
A minimalist mindset with no frill and tree.
Every penny counts, every decision weighs,
There's no room for error or practical delays.

You'll learn to wear many hats along the way,
From coding to marketing, no task too small to sway.
You'll have to put in the time and effort,
To make your business soar, and thrive in its comfort.

The struggle you face will sometimes seem endless,
But be persistent and strong, and strive to progress.
Keep a close eye on your metrics and stats,
Your numbers will reveal your highs and your lows, not fads.

Along the road, you'll come to realize,
Your business is not just a means to monetize,
It's also an extension of yourself,
A legacy product, if you will, for personal wealth.

As you attain success, you'll look back and see,
That your journey with bootstrapping was simply meant to be.
Starting up with scratch gave you the power to create,
To build something out of nothing, a passion to innovate.

So don't be afraid of starting up with scratch,
It's not the easy way, for sure, but it's worth the match.
Your journey will avail you to challenges and gains,
Always remember, the bootstrapper's heart never complains.
