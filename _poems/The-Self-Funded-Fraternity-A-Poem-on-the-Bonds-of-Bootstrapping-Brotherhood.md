# The Self-Funded Fraternity: A Poem on the Bonds of Bootstrapping Brotherhood

Oh, the self-funded fraternity!  
The bonds of bootstrapping brotherhood  
For founders of startups,  
Who know that a dollar saved today,  
Brings a brighter future tomorrow,  
As they bootstrap their dreams to reality.

They are the ones with a vision  
For a better world, they create  
The change they wish to see,  
With every penny wisely spent,  
Each decision made with care.

They are the ones who know,  
That nothing is impossible,  
If they are willing to work hard,  
And refused to let obstacles in their path  
Stop them from reaching their goal.

They are the ones who stick together,  
In the face of tough times,  
Sharing knowledge, experience,  
And resources that they have found.

They are the ones who know the value,  
Of a loyal friend and partner,  
Someone who challenges them to be their best,  
Offers support when they are down.

For it's not just about the money,  
But the brotherhood that grows  
From the struggle, hard work,  
And victories that they encounter.

On late evenings, they grind away,  
In garages, coffee shops, and co-working spaces,  
Sacrificing luxury,  
Knowing the beauty of sweat and tears,  
The price they have to pay.

Together they hustle,  
With a shared purpose in their heart  
And when the world looks away,  
They stand tall, side by side,  
Thriving in the fruitful time.

Their journey may be fraught  
With ups and downs,  
The wind blowing them this way and that,  
But they remain steadfast,  
In their determination never to give up.

For they know,  
That their fate is in their hands,  
And with effort, persistence, and innovation,  
They can achieve what others deemed impossible.

So let the self-funded fraternity reign,  
A community of bootstrapping startups,  
For whom the bonds of brotherhood  
Are forged in the crucible of entrepreneurship.  
May they keep growing stronger,  
For the betterment of mankind,  
And inspire others to follow,  
The path less traveled,  
And create a legacy,  
That will last for all time.
