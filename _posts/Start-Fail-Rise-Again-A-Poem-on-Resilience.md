# Start, Fail, Rise Again: A Poem on Resilience

In the world of startups, they say,
You must be bold, you must be brave,
For the risks are great, and the rewards high,
And sometimes you must fail before you can fly.

The journey starts with a spark of an idea,
A vision that’s nothing short of a utopia,
With conviction and passion, you take the leap,
And dive headfirst into the startup deep.

The early days are filled with zest,
You work long hours, feeling blessed,
The product takes shape, the team grows,
And you dream of the day, when the world knows.

But then comes the first of many blows,
The product fails to impress, the market slows,
The investors back off, the money dries,
And you find yourself staring at the skies.

The path you thought was set, lies in shambles,
Your confidence shattered, your dreams in rambles,
You wonder what went wrong, where it all erred,
And question if you had done your homework, your due effort.

The night is long, the thoughts are dark,
You question your abilities, your spark,
The doubts gnaw at you, the fears grip tight,
And you wonder if you have the strength to fight.

But then something shifts, something stirs,
The pain slowly fades, and something occurs,
A glimmer of hope, a whisper of light,
That nudges you to keep up the fight.

You pick yourself up, dust off the grime,
And take a step forward without wasting time,
You learn from your mistakes, you pivot your course,
And muster the courage to get back on the horse.

The startup journey is filled with such turns,
Of ups and downs, of hits and burns,
But what sets the successful ones apart,
Is the resilience and grit in their heart.

The ability to fall and rise again,
To embrace failures without any disdain,
To learn from them, to course correct,
And move forward with renewed intellect.

For resilience is not just a trait,
It’s a muscle that needs to be worked at,
With practice, patience, and self-belief,
You can weather any storm, any grief.

So, to all you founders, hustlers, and dreamers,
To those who brave the wild startup rivers,
Remember that failure is not the end,
But a chance to start anew and ascend.

Take heart and keep your chin up high,
For success is just a matter of time,
Keep your eyes set on the prize,
And let resilience be your guide.
