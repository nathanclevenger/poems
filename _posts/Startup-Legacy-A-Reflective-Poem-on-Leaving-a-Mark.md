# Startup Legacy: A Reflective Poem on Leaving a Mark

Starting a business is never easy,
But we take the leap, feeling queasy,
Determined to make something real,
A legacy that we ourselves can feel.

The sleepless nights, endless toil,
Each effort a step towards our goal,
Days go by, but we keep pushing,
Relentlessly, we keep on hustling.

We come up with an idea, a vision,
That takes form, gaining traction,
We invest, we borrow, we take risks,
Hoping for rewards that we can't miss.

Our team becomes our extended family,
Our customers become our priority,
We are consumed by what we've started,
The possibilities, endless and uncharted.

The early days are often the roughest,
Pivoting, iterating, adapting to the market,
The road is unpredictable, rough and tough,
But we keep moving forward, never to quit.

Our values are our guiding light,
Our beliefs, our very soul,
We stand firm in the face of challenges,
Never compromising, never to fold.

Startup life is one that tests us,
Challenges our limits, exposes us,
We learn to lead, to manage, to innovate,
And sometimes, to accept our inevitable fate.

The triumphs we experience are priceless,
Each win a step toward a lasting legacy,
Our passion, perseverance, and grit,
An inspiration to others, to take the same leap.

We leave behind something of value,
A reflection of our hard work and dedication,
Our startup legacy, to be seen by all,
Our mark on the world, a lasting celebration.

So let us remember what we've gained,
And honor what we've left behind,
A startup journey that's uniquely ours,
A legacy that will forever shine.
