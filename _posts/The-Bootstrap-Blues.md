# The Bootstrap Blues

The path of a startup is not paved with gold,
It's a journey with hardships, a story untold.
From the initial idea to the final product,
It's a tale of perseverance, hoping not to get stuck.

With limited funds, and a dream in mind,
The bootstrap blues can be hard to unwind.
Days and nights filled with endless work,
As the team pushes forward, they never shirk.

The buzz of excitement, the thrill of the chase,
Fuel for the fire, to win the startup race.
Investors are sought, funding is needed,
The dangers are great, one wrong step is seeded.

Fear sets in, as the first pitch looms,
But the team pushes through, leaving behind the gloom.
The pitch is successful, funds start to flow,
A team is formed, ideas begin to grow.

The road of a startup is twisting and long,
But the team perseveres, singing a different song.
Lost, but with a vision in mind,
The bootstrap blues are left behind.

The team is challenged, setbacks occur,
But back to the drawing board, and they never deter.
Prototypes are made, and the product is refined,
The team never stops, they have one thing in mind.

Their passion for progress, a drive to succeed,
Keeps them going, with greater speed.
The bootstrap blues, now just a memory,
As the team moves ahead with great solidarity.

Success is found, a company is born,
The endless hours, certainly not forlorn.
The bootstrap blues, now a thing of the past,
A story of hope, a company that will last.

The journey has been hard, but the end is sweet,
The team knows they have made the right feat.
So to all who embark on this startup life,
Embrace the hardships, and keep up the strife.

For the bootstrap blues, though hard to unwind,
Lead to success, and leaving fear far behind.
