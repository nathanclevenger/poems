# Living in Beta: A Startup State of Mind

Living in beta, a startup state of mind,  
Is where entrepreneurs seek success to find.  
They create and innovate with bold intent,  
Leaving fear and doubt behind, they're never spent.  

In this world of startups, everything's unsure,  
But there's passion and drive that's always pure.  
Every day is a chance to learn and grow,  
And every obstacle's an opportunity to glow.

They'll keep going, for they know they'll hit.  

They'll test and iterate to find what works,  
Even if sometimes it feels like it all hurts.  
For startups aren't easy, but they are fun,  
With every win, a new chapter begun.  

They're brave enough to attempt the impossible,  
Taking their idea, making it tangible.  
With every step forward, they'll chart new courses,  
Riding the wave of change, with dynamic forces.

Not just for profit, but problems solving.  
They're constantly seeking ways to impact,  
To make a difference, and that's a fact.

To push, create and never give in.

And creating a future that will forever last.

As you change the world and leave your mark.
