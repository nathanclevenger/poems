# The Iterative Innovator

In the world of startups,  
There is a term that clicks,  
Iterations are the key,  
To solving many a fix.  

The iterative innovator,  
A pursuer of perfection,  
A fearless problem solver,  
With a drive for iteration.  

The journey starts with an idea,  
A seed sown in the mind,  
It's nurtured and developed,  
As the iterative process unwinds.  

The first prototype takes shape,  
But it's never quite right,  
The iterative innovator knows,  
That they must iterate.  

Each iteration brings improvement,  
Feedback is what they seek,  
With each cycle of iteration,  
Their product becomes unique.  

It's never about perfection,  
That's a myth that's oft told,  
It's all about iterating,  
Until you reach your goal.  

Failure is not to be feared,  
It's a chance to iterate again,  
To make it better, smarter, faster,  
And stay ahead of the game.  

The iterative innovator,  
Is never satisfied with less,  
They're always seeking improvement,  
Aiming for success.  

The road ahead is long and winding,  
But the iterative innovator knows,  
That with each iteration, they're moving forward,  
Towards the success that grows.  

So if you're a startup entrepreneur,  
And you're trying to succeed,  
Remember to be an iterative innovator,  
And iterate until you've achieved.
