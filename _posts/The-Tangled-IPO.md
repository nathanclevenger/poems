# The Tangled IPO

The startup waltzed onto the scene  
With a plan, a dream, and a team  
Their innovation, a sight to see  
Was surely worth investing to me  

The market was ripe, the timing right  
Their IPO would soar to new height  
But little did they know, oh what a fright  
For the future of the startup was not quite bright  

The board had met, the strategy planned  
But the market shifted, they didn't understand  
The IPO came, but it was a mess  
Their dreams of success, left in distress  

The shares they sold, were not enough  
To keep the company from getting rough  
Their leadership was in a tangle  
Their investors began to wrangle  

The startup life is one of risk  
One moment cheers, the next in the abyss  
But this IPO had caused great pain  
Their startup never quite the same  

Their story now a cautionary tale  
Of how an IPO can derail  
But let us celebrate their try  
And never forget the reason why  

Entrepreneurs take on this life  
Filled with risk, and unknown strife  
And though some may stumble, fall and fail  
Others will rise, and with success prevail  

So here's to the startup brave and new  
With dreams that live, and ideas true  
May their IPO be not tangled, but soaring  
And their success, forevermore endearing.
