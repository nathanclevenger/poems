# The Exit Strategy

As startup life begins to take shape
And every decision seems to be at stake
There lies a question without debate
What is the exit strategy for heaven's sake?

The journey begins with a clear vision
A product or service with a mission
Chasing investors and funding dreams
Ignoring comfort, facing extremes

The nights are long and the days are slow
Time is money and it's running low
Execution is key and pivots will come
Fighting hard and thinking as one

The market is crowded and competition is high
A break isn't given even if you try
The odds are against you but you won't break
Because you know the exit strategy it'll take

IPO or an acquisition, there are options at hand
But only one can make the business grand
A stake in the ground or a cash in the bank
A decision that must be made without any rank

But what about the founders and the team that believed
A part of the journey that helped it achieve
Do they have a say or just overlook
Their hard work and loyalty overlooked

A stress test for the mind and the heart
The exit strategy, a new start
With every decision comes a price to pay
But begin with the end in mind and pave the way

The answer isn't simple and it's not a game
It's a decision that can bring fortune or shame
It's a path that shouldn't be taken lightly
As the stakes are high and emotions might get flighty

The exit strategy, a milestone reached
Acknowledging the journey, the lessons preached
Celebrating the wins, embracing the loss
A moment of reflection, at any cost

So, what is the exit strategy, you may ask
It's a torch that must be carried with a steadfast task
It's an answer that will shape the future
A reward that can be eternal or a torture

The startup life, a journey of its own
A story with highs and lows to be told
The exit strategy, a part of the plot
A decision that must be taken while giving it a thought
