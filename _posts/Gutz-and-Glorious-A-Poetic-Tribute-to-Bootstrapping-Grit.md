# Gutz and Glorious: A Poetic Tribute to Bootstrapping Grit

In this brave new world of startups,  
Where dreams and possibilities abound,  
There are those with blood, sweat and tears,  
Who know what it means to dig hard ground.  

They are the ones with guts and glory,  
Who know the value of hard work and sacrifice,  
The ones who know that success isn't a story,  
But a journey of incredible strife.  

Bootstrapping is their way of life,  
A path with many pitfalls and potholes,  
But they walk it with determination and strife,  
With grit, with grace, with staunch souls.  

Through times that are lean and tough,  
Through challenges that seem insurmountable,  
They hold their head high, their spirits rough,  
And with persistence and passion, they conquer all.  

They know that bootstrapping means embracing risk,  
But it pales in comparison to the rewards,  
The thrill of building something truly unique,  
The joy of creating lasting bonds.  

They face their fears with courage and determination,  
Their resolve never waivering, come what may,  
They buckle down, refocus and find inspiration,  
And in the end, their dreams come to stay.  

With their own two hands, they create their fate,  
They build a legacy that will long endure,  
And when the going gets tough, they innovate,  
For they know that their grit is their truest allure.  

So here's to the ones who bootstrap and hustle,  
Who know that the journey is the true reward,  
Who face the storm with their heads held high,  
And whose grit and gloriousness can never be ignored.  

This is a tribute to the ones who pave the way,  
For all the entrepreneurs yet to come,  
May the spirit of bootstrapping never fade,  
And may their fire burn bright like the sun.  

So let's raise a glass to the ones who grind,  
To the ones who make the impossible come true,  
May their spirit of determination never die,  
For they are the ones we truly owe it to. 

For they are the guts and the glory,  
The ones with the backbone of steel,  
The ones who will rise, fight and stand tall,  
And whose bootstrapping grit will always prevail.
