# The Unicorn Hunter's Manifesto

I am the Unicorn Hunter, 
Bold, fearless and true,
I have no fear of failure,
No matter what I pursue.

I hunt for the rarest of treasures,
The ones that few have seen,
I search for the mythical beasts,
The ones that people dream.

I am a hunter of unicorns,
Not the kind you find in stories,
But the ones that make startups grow,
And drive business glories.

I seek out the unique and new,
The company with a spark,
I seek out the game-changers,
The ones that light up the dark.

I am not afraid to take a chance,
To grab hold of a wild idea,
I'll pursue it with all my might,
And never show any fear.

I'll face down the naysayers,
And keep pushing through the pain,
For I know the work will pay off,
And the profit is the gain.

I'll never be content with status quo,
Or settle for mediocrity,
For I am the Unicorn Hunter,
And I'll always seek originality.

I'll work day and night,
I'll put in the extra mile,
For I know that success is a journey,
Not just a final destination style.

I'll choose my team as carefully,
As the company we'll create,
And together we'll chase our dreams,
And the world will watch and celebrate.

We'll make magic happen,
With every single stride,
And we'll prove that unicorns are real,
When we all ride together side by side.

So let us now proclaim,
That we are Unicorn Hunters true,
And that nothing can stop us,
From seeing our vision through.

Let us create the future,
The one that we all desire,
Let us build a world of wonder,
With our diligence set on fire.

For we are the Unicorn Hunters!
And our dream is in the making,
With every step we take we'll be reminded,
That our destiny is ours for the taking.

So come along and join us!
We promise it will be a ride,
As we chase our elusive prey,
And together reach our destiny and stride.

In conclusion, let it be known,
That the Unicorn Hunter's Manifesto,
Is more than just a poem,
It's a challenge to all of you who dare to show.

So rise up and join us,
As we build the next Unicorn,
Together we'll make dreams come true,
And forever we'll stand reborn.
