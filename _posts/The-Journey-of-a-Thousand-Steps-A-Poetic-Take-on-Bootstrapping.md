# The Journey of a Thousand Steps: A Poetic Take on Bootstrapping

It starts with a spark, a glint in the eye
A dream that takes hold, that you can’t deny
A passion for something, a vision so clear
And the knowledge that, you have no fear

You set out on the journey, with hope in your heart
With nothing to lose, and everything to start
You take the first step, with a leap of faith
And embrace the unknown, with every breath you take

You work long hours, with sweat on your brow
You inch closer and closer, with every step somehow
You face each challenge, with a fierce determination
And overcome each obstacle, with pure imagination

You take risks and make mistakes, they’re all part of the game
You accept them and learn, and move on all the same
You juggle each task, with creativity and skill
And push forward harder, with an unbreakable will

The road is long, and the journey is hard
But with each step you take, you become more unmarred
You build a foundation, with each brick well-laid
And lay the groundwork, for the future you’ve made

You see growth and success, with every passing day
And your dream slowly takes shape, in the most beautiful way
You stand tall and proud, with your head held high
And look back at the journey, with a grateful sigh

For it all started with a spark, a glint in the eye
A dream that took hold, that could not be denied
But it was the journey of a thousand steps, that brought it to life
The bootstrapping path you chose, that led to glory and strife
