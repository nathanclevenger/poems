# The Startup Safari

Ready to embark on a journey,
Into the wild unknown,
A startup safari, we shall take,
To build a company we call our own.

Through the vast and never-ending savannah,
We strive to survive and thrive,
Chasing after elusive dreams,
With persistence to help us thrive.

A new adventure awaits each day,
As we explore the uncharted ground,
Hurdles and obstacles we'll face,
But we'll always find a way around.

The sun beats down upon our faces,
A fiery blaze in the sky,
But we push on with heads held high,
Determined never to die.

The heat of competition is all around,
As we race other startups to the top,
The thrill of the chase keeps us sharp,
And we never let our game stop.

Sometimes we follow the herd,
And sometimes we go solo,
But we always follow our own path,
And stay true to our company's motto.

We've got our eyes set on the prize,
And nothing can get in our way,
We're building a startup from the ground up,
And making our dreams come true, day by day.

Our journey can be long and treacherous,
But we're prepared to take the risk,
We're fearless and unbreakable,
Ready for any obstacle or trick.

Our thirst for knowledge never ends,
As we learn from every twist and turn,
We'll grow and evolve as a team,
And together we shall learn.

If we stumble and fall,
We'll pick ourselves right back up,
And carry on, strong and determined,
It's the startup life we love.

So let's grab our compasses and maps,
And pack our bags full of bravery,
Into the wild we shall venture,
Taking the startup safari.
