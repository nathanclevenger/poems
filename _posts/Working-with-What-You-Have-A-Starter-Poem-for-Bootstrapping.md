# Working with What You Have: A Starter Poem for Bootstrapping

When you're starting from scratch,
and cash is in short supply,
you may wonder how to spark,
your startup's upward climb.

But fear not, dear entrepreneur,
for there's a way to begin,
with resourcefulness and grit,
you'll soon see a win.

First things first, assess what you've got,
the skills and knowledge you can bring,
the friends and allies you can count,
and the time you can dedicate.

With those assets in hand,
consider how you can leverage,
to create something new,
with minimal financial pressure.

Maybe it's a service you can offer,
based on your unique expertise,
or perhaps a product you can sell,
that's been put on the backseat.

Find your niche and fill it well,
with excellence and pride,
and watch how word of mouth spreads,
your reputation to sky-high.

Invest in yourself,
and what you can learn and do,
let every setback incite,
an ever-stronger breakthrough.

Look for opportunities,
and pivot with an open mind,
versatility is key,
to successes you'll find.

And most importantly,
be honest, humble and true,
to yourself, your team, your customers,
in all that you pursue.

For bootstrapping may seem daunting,
but it's a path to be embraced,
with hard work, creativity,
and a spirit that can't be replaced.

So go ahead, dear reader,
and embark on this rewarding ride,
working with what you have,
and letting it be your guide.
