# The Lean Startup

Innovation drives the startup life,  
Bringing new ideas to the fore.  
But creating a business that thrives,  
Requires strategy and much more.  

Enter the lean startup approach,  
A method designed to help us grow.  
Test, experiment, and pivot with tact,   
The key is to take things slow.  

The goal is not to launch with a bang,  
But to learn and improve with each step.  
To validate ideas and minimize risk,  
And make sure the market will accept.  

The essence of the lean startup,  
Is to build, measure, and learn,  
Using feedback to adjust our work,  
And see our businesses turn.  

We start with a hypothesis,  
A solution we believe will sell.  
Then build a prototype to test the waters,  
And validate the idea well.  

From there it's on to the MVP,  
Or minimum viable product, they say.  
A product simple but functional,  
To gauge the market's interest that day.  

We listen and learn from our users,  
Seeing what they buy and what they don't.  
Try different things to see what sticks,  
And adjust as we meld and we hone.  

We quickly iterate our ideas,  
Adding features one by one.  
We test, measure, and learn some more,  
Until we see the needle is spun.  

The goal is not perfection,  
But rather to create a base.  
A product that will match the market,  
And meet customer needs in their own space.  

The lean approach comes with benefits,  
A quicker time to market and lower cost.  
A better chance that our products will stick,  
And our brand will not be lost.  

But make no mistake, it's hard work,  
And requires persistence and drive.  
To stay the course and see it through,  
And keep pushing to arrive.  

In the end, the lean startup approach,  
Is more than just a process to create.  
It's a mindset and a philosophy,  
For founders who won't accept fate.  

So let's embrace the lean startup way,  
And learn from each small test.  
To make our businesses the best they can be,  
And always remain ahead of the rest.
