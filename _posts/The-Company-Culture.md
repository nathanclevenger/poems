# The Company Culture

In the world of startups, there’s a phrase
That’s often repeated in countless ways:
“The company culture is what will thrive,
And keep the business truly alive.”

But what is culture? It’s hard to define,
A nebulous concept, like mist that’s divine,
It seeps through the walls and infuses the air,
Creating a vibe that’s both unique and rare.

Is it ping pong tables, and bean bag chairs?
Is it free lunches, and parties upstairs?
Is it casual dress, and Friday beer?
Or is it something intangible, that’s more sincere?

It’s all of these things, and yet it’s not,
It’s an attitude, a mindset, a way to wrought
A common goal, that the team will pursue,
To build something great, something that’s new.

The company culture is what sets it apart,
From all the others, that don’t have heart.
It’s the glue that holds the team together,
Through the highs and the lows, in any weather.

It’s a sense of purpose, that’s shared by all,
A dream that’s big, and never too small.
It’s a passion for excellence, in all that they do,
And a willingness to learn, before saying “I knew.”

It’s a respect for diversity, and a welcoming tone,
For different backgrounds, each with their own,
For ideas that challenge, and for constructive critique,
And an environment that’s safe, for all who seek.

The company culture is a living thing,
It’s not something stagnant, that’s waiting to spring,
It’s dynamic and evolving, and ever-changing,
As the team grows, and continues rearranging.

It’s built brick by brick, and day by day,
Through shared experiences, and in every way,
It’s nurtured and cared for, by all who belong,
And through their efforts, it remains strong.

So, here’s to the company culture, may it thrive and grow,
May it inspire and motivate, and continue to show,
That it’s the heart of the startup, the soul of the team,
And without it, the business is nothing but a dream.
