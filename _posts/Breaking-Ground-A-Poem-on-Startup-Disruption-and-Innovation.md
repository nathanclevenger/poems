# Breaking Ground: A Poem on Startup Disruption and Innovation

Breaking ground, breaking free
Starting up, with eyes to see
A world full of problems, to solve and to mend
Innovation arises, to shake and transcend

A spark ignites, a thought takes flight
The first seed planted, a dream so bright
With sweat and tears, with sleepless nights
A vision takes form, with boldness and might

Disruption arises, to challenge the norms
The old ways, the status quo, all reborn
A path uncharted, with no clear signs
Risk is accepted, to pave new lines

Innovation sets forth, to create and renew
Changing the game, with ideas anew
With persistence and passion, with heart and soul
Startups take on, the impossible goal

The road ahead, is not for the faint
With challenges abound, and the odds to taint
But the fire within, it will not be quenched
A startup's engine, cannot be clenched

Breaking ground, breaking free
A startup's journey, is not for the idle or weak
A mission to disrupt, to make a change
A chance to innovate, to play a new game

Success is not guaranteed, nor an entrepreneur's fate
But with hard work and grit, the impossible seems great
And when it all clicks, when it falls into place
The triumph is sweet, with a smile on a face

Breaking ground, breaking free
Startup life, it's not just a salary
It's a passion, a dream, a chance to leave a mark
It's a quest for innovation, with an unwavering heart

So to all you startups out there, take heed
Embrace the journey, with all its speed
And when you face a bump, just keep going
For breaking ground, it's what startups are owning.
