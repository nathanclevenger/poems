# The Angel Investor

There was a man, so fair and wise,  
Who had a heart that shined like skies.  
He loved to see the world grow,  
And helped the startups, to reach the crescendo.

He knew the magic of a brilliant idea,  
And how it could make the world easier.  
He believed in the dreams of the young,  
And saw the potential in where they begun.

With his guidance, he made them strong,  
And with his resources, they carried on.  
He gave wings to their aspirations,  
And set them on the path of elation.

The angel investor was his name,  
And his deeds were like a game.  
A game of chance, but he never lost,  
Because he knew how to pay the cost.

He invested in the ideas, that no one saw,  
And made them into big stars, like never before.  
He brought them to the light, from the shadows,  
And made their vision, into tomorrow.

He nurtured their ideas, with his wisdom,  
And urged them to pursue their ambitions.  
He was a partner, a mentor, and a friend,  
Who stayed till the end.

With his wealth, he created growth,  
And with his guidance, he gave hope.  
He knew the struggles of a startup life,   
And became the solution, with a simple strife.

He was there, when no one else was,  
And believed in them, when others lost the cause.  
He made them stand tall, and firm,  
And made them invincible, in the stormy term.

The angel investor, was a blessing true,  
Who gave his all, they never knew.  
But he didn't need a recognition too,  
For his joy lied, in the dream come true.

So, if you have a dream, and hope to grow,  
Look for the angel investor in the row.  
He may change your life, and your fate,  
Because the angel investor, is never late.  

In the end, I say this with glee,  
The world needs more, like the angel investor, you and me.  
So, let's spread the love and create magic,  
For the startup life, is a playground fantastic.
