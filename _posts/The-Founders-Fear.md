# The Founder's Fear

The life of a startup founder
Is full of uncertainty and fear
Of failure, rejection and unknowns
That constantly linger near.

Each step taken feels like a risk 
That could lead to success or failure
With no guaranteed outcome to be found
To calm the nerves and calm the heart's flutter.

The founder's fear is not just their own
But shared with each team member and investor
All holding their breath with hope and trepidation
Waiting for the project's future.

The founder's fear is a heavy burden
Carried upon their hearts and minds
As they navigate the many challenges
Of creating something from nothing entwined.

They worry about the lack of funding
Hoping it won't deter the work
And that the possibility of success
Will be enough to avoid the worst.

Their fears are amplified by the questions
That accompany every trial and triumph
Will the technology catch on, will the market be ready?
Can the team work together to solve the complex problem?

As days and weeks turn to months and years
The founder's fears remain close by
Yet they hold on to hope and to each other
As they push through, asking why?

Why do this? Why put themselves through this stress?
Why take the risk of failure and potential loss?
The answer lies in the passion and drive 
That fuels them to do what they do without pause.

For the founder's fear is not the end
But just the beginning of a journey
A journey full of ups and downs 
And a future that's still murky.

So to all the founders out there
Don't give up, don't let go of the fire
The road may be long and the risks great,
But the reward is worth the entire tire.

For the founder's fear is just a test
Of the strength and resolve within
And with determination, grit, and a "never give up" mentality
Success can be found once again.
