# The Heart of a Coder

A coder, he sits at his desk
Day in and day out, he does his best  
In his mind, code abounds  
As he types away without a sound.

Deep in thought, his fingers fly  
His passion for coding never dies  
Lines of text, a sight to see  
The world of coding is where he longs to be.

He speaks in tongues that others can't  
His code is like a work of art  
With each keystroke, he pours his soul  
Into the machine, he gives his all.

The heart of a coder is a unique thing  
A passion that others can't see within  
They spend hours writing and solving bugs  
Their commitment to code never shrugs.

Syntax errors, a coder's foe  
They bring him down, but never low  
He'll spend hours fixing a tiny bug  
For it's his code that he cherishes, and that's no bluff.

Code is more than just mere text  
It's an extension of the coder's inner self  
A reflection of his thoughts and dreams  
His code is more than it may seem.

The heart of a coder beats with passion  
For the art that he creates with his keyboard action  
He never tires, for he knows  
That there is always more to code and grow.

His work may go unnoticed by most  
But the coder knows the value of his code host  
For each line represents his heart and soul  
And that's what makes it truly whole.

So cherish the heart of a coder  
And the devotion that he brings  
For his code is not just a program  
It's a reflection of everything.

In the code, you'll find his passion  
And his dedication to the craft  
His heart, his mind, and soul all bask  
In the art he creates, that will everlast.

The heart of a coder is truly unique  
A mind that thinks in code and never sleeps  
So embrace the coder within you  
For he is a reflection of all that is true.
