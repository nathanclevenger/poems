# The Creative Destruction

In startup life, we all strive  
To disrupt, to change, to thrive  
To build a product that's brand new  
And change the world that we view  

But innovation starts with fear  
Of failure and of loss so near  
We take a risk and let it be  
Creative destruction, wild and free  

We challenge what we think we know  
And break the molds that hold us low  
We dare to think beyond the norm  
And bring new ideas into form  

But with creativity comes strife  
And with the new, the old must die  
We tear down what we hold so dear  
And replace it with that which we fear  

We rip up roots and tear apart  
The things we've cherished in our heart  
But in that void something grows  
A possibility no one knows  

The creative destruction we seek  
Brings both beauty and critique  
It's in the hardships that we find  
The opportunities to bind  

We break things down to build anew  
Our visions, dreams and goals to pursue  
We tumble through the unknown  
But it's the risks that we must hone  

It takes a heart that's brave and bold  
To step into the unknown wilderness so old  
But there we'll find the light that shines  
And the fruits of our creative vines  

So if you're faced with fear and dread  
And want to thrive instead  
Remember that creative destruction  
Is the path to success and construction  

For startups need the daring few  
Who face the unknown and see it through  
To build the future, bright and true  
And change the world that we all view.
