# The Unicorn Quest

In the world of startups, there is a quest
For the elusive unicorn, we do our best
The one startup that will reign supreme
That will fulfill all our wildest dreams

We chase after investors day and night
Pitching our ideas with all our might
Hoping they will see the potential
And invest in our startup essential

We create our teams with care and thought
Hiring talents we think will be taught
To bring our vision to life
To turn our dreams into a corporate strife

We pivot and iterate, we never rest
We will do what it takes to be the best
We analyze and strategize, we learn from mistakes
We keep going forward, no matter what it takes

And in the midst of this startup race
We strive to remember our original embrace
Of why we started this venture in the first place
To make a difference and leave our mark in time and space

And as we continue on this unicorn quest
We must remember to put our team to the test
With the same care and dedication we give our startup
To ensure their well-being doesn't take a backstop

For in the end, it is not just about success
But how we get there, with grace and finesse
And leaving a legacy that will outlast our days
A startup journey full of color and rays

So here's to the unicorn we seek
That we will one day hold and keep
But also to the journey we take
And the memories we will never forsake.
