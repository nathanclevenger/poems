# Whatever It Takes: A Poem on the Mantra of Bootstrapped Startups

Boots strapped tight and ready to go
The journey ahead, a challenge I know
But with grit and determination by my side
I will push forward, I will not hide

The road ahead is long and winding
But the passion inside me is binding
I will not falter, I will not sway
My dream is too great, my vision too clear

The nights are long and the days are hard
But I will never give up, I will not be scarred
I will keep pushing, I will keep fighting
Until my success is palpable and enlightening

Failure is not an option, it's just a part of the ride
We learn from our mistakes, we don't hide
We pick ourselves up, we dust off the grit
We keep moving forward, we never quit

We hustle hard, we work long hours
We pour our hearts and souls into our powers
We sacrifice, we do whatever it takes
To make our companies grow and flourish with grace

We bootstrap our startups, we rely on ourselves
We build our business with hard work and stealth
We earn every penny with blood, sweat, and tears
We create a future that outweighs our fears

Our journey is tough, but we are tougher
We embrace the grind, we welcome the suffer
We know that our dreams are worth the fight
We chase them relentlessly, both day and night

We are the bootstrapped startups, we rise from nothing
We create something great, out of the blue yonder
We may not have deep pockets, we may not have fame
But we have the spirit, the drive, and the game

We believe in ourselves, we believe in our dream
We keep moving forward, we never retreat
We are the ones who make a difference
With grit, determination, and passionate persistence

So let us raise our glasses, and toast to our success
To the bootstrapped startups, who never rest
We know who we are, and what we do
And we will keep pushing, whatever it takes, to see our dream come true.
