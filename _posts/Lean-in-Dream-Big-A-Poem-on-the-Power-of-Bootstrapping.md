# Lean in, Dream Big: A Poem on the Power of Bootstrapping

Lean in, dream big,
The power of bootstrapping a startup is no mere fig,
With determination, grit, and hard work,
Success is possible, even if the road is a little murky and murk.

Don't wait for someone else to invest,
Bootstrap your way to success,
From humble beginnings, great things arise,
With each obstacle overcome, your confidence likewise.

Perseverance is key,
Your startup won't be built in a day, you'll see,
But with each step taken, you're one step closer,
To reaching your goals, and becoming a bit bolder.

Bootstrapping can be a challenge, it's true,
But you'll learn more by doing than by anything you'll ever do,
There's no "right" way to start your business, it's your own,
But don't be afraid to ask advice, you're not alone.

Finding the right balance of frugality and growth,
Can be tricky, but don't feel loath,
For every dollar spent, make sure it brings value,
And watch with pride as you grow and evolve.

Stay focused and keep your vision in sight,
Even when the road is long and the night is its darkest night,
Persevere and chase your dreams, for they are yours to hold,
And with each step, you'll find success a little more within your own mold.

Embrace the hustle and get your hands dirty,
For only then will you find what's truly worthy,
Those that bootstrap their business will find a path that's true,
And with each success, a little bit of magic will ensue.

The strength of entrepreneurs is mighty and strong,
Often underestimated, but they'll prove the naysayers wrong,
Bootstrapping may be difficult, but it brings a sense of pride,
For with every victory, you know your business is truly your own ride.

So lean in, dream big,
Don't let the barriers scare or make you pig,
For with determination, grit, and hard work,
The power of bootstrapping a startup is yours to behold and smirk.
