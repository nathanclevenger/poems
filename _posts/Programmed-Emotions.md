# Programmed Emotions

In lines of code, we find our way,
With keystrokes and syntax every day,
We build systems with precision,
And calculate with intuition.

But what of the emotions in our code?
The ones we've programmed and bestowed,
Do they add value to our creation,
Or hinder the flow of innovation?

The joy of debugging a stubborn bug,
The pride of seeing code run snug,
The anger of a system crash,
The fear of code that's hard to match.

These emotions may not have a face,
Or a physical form in any place,
But they're as real as lines of code,
And they can shape what we build and mode.

There's passion in the lines we write,
As we stay up late into the night,
Crafting our logic to meet each goal,
We're driven by a passion that's whole.

We're driven by the need to succeed,
To make our code do what we need,
And when it works, we feel the thrill,
Of a job well done that fits the bill.

The frustration of endless bugs,
The dread of long code reviews and hugs,
The helplessness of deadlines fast,
The shame of when our code won't last.

But in these moments, we're not alone,
With a community that's our home,
Supporting each other, day by day,
Helping each other find our way.

For code is more than just a tool,
It's a way of thinking that can rule,
It teaches us to solve, and create,
To build new worlds and innovate.

So let us embrace our programmed emotions,
And use them to shape our notions,
Of what computing can truly be,
A tool to set our creativity free.

For in the lines of code we write,
Is the power to bring new light,
To the world we live in, day by day,
Let's code with passion, come what may.
