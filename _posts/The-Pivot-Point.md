# The Pivot Point

Amid the chaos and the strife,
Comes a moment in startup life,
A turning point, a crucial choice,
The pivot point where you find your voice.

Things aren't going quite as planned,
Your market share isn't in demand,
Your vision's blurry, the team's at odds,
And investors aren't throwing wads.

You could keep going down this track,
Watch your dream drift slowly back,
Or take a breath, a moment's pause,
Consider what your pivot clause.

The pivot point can be scary,
Seems like giving up or being wary,
But sometimes it's what makes you great,
And decides whether it's a mistake.

A pivot can transform your fate,
Change your focus, alter your gait,
Can open doors you never knew,
And set your business on a path anew.

It's not about giving up the fight,
It's about embracing what's in sight,
Looking at the market with fresh eyes,
And finding a new place to rise.

Perhaps it's time to shift your aim,
Rebrand or tweak your niche's name,
Or focus squarely on that one thing,
A pivot strategy that makes you king.

The pivot point can be a boon,
A catalyst to reach the moon,
Jumpstart your growth, spike your sales,
And leave the competition in your trails.

It's a turning point in your quest,
A compass pointing to your best,
A pivot point to steer your team,
Through uncertainty into your dream.

And though it might be bumpy terrain,
And people may call you insane,
Remember that the greatest risk,
Is not giving that pivot a brisk.

So embrace this pivot point with glee,
Your startup life will soon run free,
Find your footing, find your voice,
And watch as your business start a new noise.
