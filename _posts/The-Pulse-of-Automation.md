# The Pulse of Automation

In the land of coding,  
Where the machines never rest  
There's a pulse of automation,  
A rhythm that's truly blessed  

From the tap of a keyboard,  
To the hum of a drive  
We are lost in its power,  
As we watch the code come alive  

Beneath the surface,  
In the depths of the code  
Lies a world of automation,  
Where our secrets are stowed  

Files are transferred,  
And commands are given  
The automation pulses,  
As if it's truly livin'  

With a click of a button,  
Our tasks are complete  
The pulse of automation,  
Keeps the workflow neat  

Days of laborious tasks,  
Are now a thing of the past  
As the machines take charge,  
Our job becomes a blast  

The heartbeat of technology,  
Pounds like a drum  
As the code flows through,  
Our work is never done  

In this world of coding,  
Where the machines reign supreme  
Our coding skills are the key,  
The automated pulse is the dream  

So let's embrace automation,  
And the pulse it generates  
For in the world of coding,  
The machines carry our fates  

With each passing moment,  
The pulse grows ever more  
Automation's our friend,  
And our ally forevermore  

We'll continue to code,  
And let the machines lead the way  
For the pulse of automation,  
Is the beating heart of this modern day.
