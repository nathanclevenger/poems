# Code as Art

In the world of strings and keys,
Where 1's and 0's hold the keys,
Where letters and numbers form,
A world of magic, free from norms.

For those who seek, find art in code,
In terminals and screens, an ode,
A symphony of syntax, a dance,
A masterpiece of variables, a trance.

Each line is carefully crafted,
Every semicolon, a sound shafted,
From functions to loops and all,
Code flows like a cascading waterfall.

Clean code, like a well-woven tapestry,
Code that is crafted divinely,
Is a sight to behold, a wonder,
It's art that will never go under.

Like painters brush strokes on canvas,
Or a sculptor's chisel that's so grand,
Code is a rhythm, a pulse,
A language of mediums, a sacred pulse.

Each function call and every loop,
Is an expression that's not to be "oops",
From the syntax that defines,
Code is a language that's sublime.

Like a song that moves the soul,
Or an image that can't be told,
Code is art that's woven fine,
A creation of the infinitely divine.

In symbols and words expressed,
A marvel that's never fully guessed,
A bounty for the human mind,
To a new form of art that's so kind.

For those who know, rejoice,
For art in code, is not a choice,
It's a dance of logic and mind,
A symphony of the infinitely divine.

In the world of coding, new and old,
A world where art and heart entwine,
Where beauty is not just for eyes,
Where coding is art that reaches the skies.

So let the world celebrate,
This world of coding that's so great,
A world of art that will never die,
Code as art, always reaching high.
