# Carving Your Own Path: A Poem on Bootstrapping Startups

Bootstrapping startups, a path few choose  
A journey of risk, of heart and of will  
A path of hard work, and little schmooze  
A path of perseverance, against all still  

A venture into the unknown abyss  
To pave our way, and carve our own path  
To build from the ground up, a legacy to dismiss  
The norms that we reject, in this ancient caste  

We work through countless restless nights  
With little rest, and little respite  
Convinced our vision will spread, beyond our lights  
With every obstacle, a victory in sight  

We seek not funding, but customer feedback  
To hone our craft, and build our brand  
To perfect our product, and to keep on track  
To satisfy clients, who'll rave and demand  

We take care though, to not be wasteful  
Of time or of money, of resources that count  
To stretch our dollars, and be resourceful  
And make every penny, a crucial amount  

And though we may stumble, and mistakes be made  
We will not falter, we'll rise and stand  
Brushing off the dirt, and still unafraid  
Our bootstrap spirit, we'll make a demand  

We'll innovate, and bring a new dawn  
To the world of business, our path we'll pave  
For we are the ones, who dare to go on  
And carve our own path, to triumph through waves  

So to those who choose, to bootstrap your way  
Carve your own path, and make your own day  
Take heed and stay strong, with spirit ablaze  
For in the end, on top you will raise  

In the world of startups, it's not about fame  
It's about creating, and making a name  
And in the end, it's not about the money that came  
But the bootstrapped spirit, that brought your success to claim  

So here's to the bootstrapping, the risk and the thrill  
And the courage to carve, our own path uphill  
For in the end, our legacy we will instill  
And in our achievement, our spirit shall fulfill.
