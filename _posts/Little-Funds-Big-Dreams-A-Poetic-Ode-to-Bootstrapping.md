# Little Funds, Big Dreams: A Poetic Ode to Bootstrapping 

In the world of business and startups,
Money is always on our minds.
But sometimes, all we have is spare change,
No investors to be found.
In these moments we must be resourceful,
And learn to bootstrap our way to the top.

With little funds, and big dreams
We set out on our journey.
The uphill battle filled with pitfalls,
But we’re ready to take on what comes our way.

We’re scrappy and witty,
Making the most of our resources.
We ignore the naysayers,
And push past any obstacles.

Our minds are sharp, and our hearts are strong,
As we navigate the rough terrain.
We’ll pivot when we need to,
But we never stray from our end goal.

Every penny counts,
And we make it stretch as far as we can.
We’re always on the hunt for savings,
And don’t let any expense go unchecked.

But it’s not just about the money,
It’s about the passion that drives us.
We believe in our vision,
And are willing to put in the hard work.

We collaborate with like-minded individuals,
And build a network of support.
Our community is our strength,
And we rise above any challenge.

With every small victory,
We gain momentum on our journey.
Our dreams are inching closer,
And we continue to chase them relentlessly.

We’re building something from nothing,
And it’s an exhilarating feeling.
We take pride in our resourcefulness,
And wouldn’t have it any other way.

With little funds, and big dreams,
We ignite the flame within.
The sky is the limit,
And we’re reaching for the stars.

So here’s to the bootstrappers,
The ones who make something out of nothing.
Your determination and grit,
Will lead you to achieve greatness.

Keep striving for success,
And the world will take notice.
Little funds may start you off,
But big dreams will carry you through.
