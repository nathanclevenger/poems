# The Sound of Syntax

The tap-tap-tap of keys I hear,

The gentle hum of code so clear,

Each line a breath, in rhythm beats,

A symphony of tech and feats.



The *if else* starts the melody,

The **for loop** adds complexity,

Strings and arrays, in harmony,

Creating functions, so perfectly.



The sound of syntax fills the air,

A language, unique and rare,

It's poetry in motion, you see,

A story of logic, told so free.



The *HTML*, a canvas blank,

A framework, to hold our rank,

*CSS* adds a touch of class,

From this, a website comes to pass.



And then, we have the mighty *JavaScript*,

A language full of power, no less,

It animates, it validates,

The very soul of web creation.



Oh, how the sound of syntax can inspire,

A coder's heart, with such desire,

To build, to create, to innovate,

With every keystroke, we activate.



For coding's not just work, you know,

It's art, it's science, it's a flow,

Of logical thinking, and problem-solving,

Of new discoveries, forever evolving.



So, let the sound of syntax be heard,

Let it echo, like a songbird,

For it's a symphony of our time,

Our code will last, like a noble rhyme.



In every line, there's a story to tell,

A tale of wonders, that we can spell,

Each keystroke, builds a structure,

A virtual world, an abstract wonder.



The sound of syntax, a language we speak,

A universal code, that we all seek,

From Silicon Valley, to Timbuktu,

A language, that we all pursue.



So, let the sound of syntax dance,

Like a ballerina, in perfect trance,

For it's a language, that speaks true,

A story of our dreams, all anew.



And when we code and create,

We give breath to this poetic state,

For in every line, is a story told,

A symphony, of new worlds to unfold.



So, let the sound of syntax resonate,

Through the keystrokes, that we all create,

For it's a music, that we all hear,

A language, that we all revere.



In the end, it's the sound of syntax,

That shapes our future, and our past,

For it's a music, that never fades,

A language, that never betrays.



And so, we praise the sound of syntax,

A language, that we all relax,

For it's a poetry, that we create,

A code, that we all appreciate.
