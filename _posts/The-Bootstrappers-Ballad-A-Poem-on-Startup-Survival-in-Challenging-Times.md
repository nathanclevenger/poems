# The Bootstrapper's Ballad: A Poem on Startup Survival in Challenging Times

Oh Bootstrapper, my dear friend,
What trials and travails we do attend,
We set out on a quest so grand,
To build our dreams upon this land.

The road is rough, the path is steep,
Yet on we trudge, our spirit deep,
For overcoming odds is what we do,
We're Bootstrappers, through and through.

From sunrise 'til the day is done,
We work and hustle, never shun,
The tasks at hand, we soldier on,
Until our prize is fully won.

But in this game, the rules do change,
The playing field can rearrange,
One day we're up, the next we fall,
Our hopes and dreams in peril all.

The market shifts, the tide does turn,
Our once bright future starts to burn,
And though we try and try again,
The climb becomes steeper, the night sets in.

But Bootstrappers don't just give up,
We pivot, adapt, without a hiccup,
We take a breath, we push through the pain,
And emerge again to fight the rain.

For in this world of startups brave,
The Bootstrapper must be bold and brave,
With a mind that's open, and heart that's true,
We'll find our way, we'll make it through.

So take heart, dear Bootstrapper friend,
This journey's long, but it too shall end,
And when we look back, with pride we'll see,
The challenges that forged us, strong and free.
