# Starting Smart: A Thought-Provoking Poem on the Art of Bootstrapping

There are those who start with big investments,
A master-plan, and plenty of provisions;
With all their ducks in row, they launch with ease,
And hope they'll succeed, but they've got no expertise.

Yet others have to keep considerate paces,
Building bit by bit, as they navigate new spaces.
No bootstraps here, just pure grit and guts,
They start from scratch, with no ifs or buts.

Their resources are meager, but their drive is fierce,
Armed with passion and instinct, their mission they will pierce.
They learn from mistakes, for there's nobody to teach,
They experiment and adapt, they know how to reach.

They sense the market, and they take risks,
With each obstacle topped, their success brisk.
They puzzle through problems, with razor-sharp wit,
And persist through the night, until they make their hit.

Bootstrapping's their art, it's their melody and verse,
They paint with their ideas, and their vision's inverse.
Like a plant that sprouts from a seed in the ground,
They start small but grow big, without making a sound.

Their tanks they refill with each little win,
And show grit and resilience again and again.
They grow with each won battle, never getting complacent,
While bigger rivals may end up obsolete and ancient.

For these starters, success has a different taste,
It's not just the outcome, it's the journey embraced.
They grow as they go, and remain nimble and lean,
Building a business that's fit for a winning team.

There's nothing more satisfying than starting from scratch,
With just your own wits, your dreams, and your watch.
For days may be long, but eventually they will pass,
And once you find success, nothing else will surpass.

So may this poem be a tribute to starting smart,
To risking and learning, to living on a dime,
May it be inspiration for anyone finding a start,
To keep it real and simple, and to stay the bootstrapped rhyme.
