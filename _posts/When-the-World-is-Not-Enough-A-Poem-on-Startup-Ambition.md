# When the World is Not Enough: A Poem on Startup Ambition

When the world is not enough,
And you're craving something more,
A startup can be the answer,
To pursuits you can't ignore.

With passion burning bright,
And ideas fresh and bold,
You set out on a journey,
To create something to behold.

The hurdles may seem daunting,
And the path may not be clear,
But failure is a teacher,
And progress is always near.

The nights may be sleepless,
The days may be long,
But the thought of success,
Keeps your spirit strong.

You pour your heart and soul,
Into every single task,
And your persistence pays off,
When you see your first big ask.

You set out to solve problems,
And make lives easier for all,
You work with dedication,
To answer every single call.

While others may doubt you,
And success may seem far away,
Your unwavering conviction,
Is what drives you every day.

You learn to network smartly,
And build a team that's strong,
Together you'll accomplish,
Everything that you've longed.

There will be setbacks aplenty,
And rejections may be the norm,
But the journey of a startup,
Is about weathering the storm.

So hold your head up high,
And believe in what you do,
The world is your playground,
And your startup your venue.

With every challenge you overcome,
And each problem that you solve,
Your vision becomes clearer,
And your resolve becomes more evolved.

When the world is not enough,
And you're looking to do more,
A startup may just be the answer,
To your unexplored score.

So take a leap of faith,
And embrace your startup dream,
For with hard work and ambition,
Your potential is supreme.
