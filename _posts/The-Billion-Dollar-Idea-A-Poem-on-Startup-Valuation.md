# The Billion Dollar Idea: A Poem on Startup Valuation

In the world of startups, there is one thing that reigns supreme,
The valuation, that magic number, the dream.

Entrepreneurs chase it, investors seek it,
It's a number that can make or break it.

A billion dollars, the holy grail,
A unicorn startup, the fairy tale.

But what is it that makes a startup worth so much,
Is it the team, the product, or just a lucky touch?

A vision that's grand, a market that's hot,
A product that's disruptive, that's what they've got.

But numbers don't lie, they tell the tale,
Of revenue, growth, and how they'll scale.

Valuation metrics, they come and they go,
From price to sales to EBITDA, they all show.

The investors, they haggle, they push and they pull,
For a fair valuation that's beneficial to all.

And when they agree, the deal is done,
The founders celebrate, the investors, they've won.

But it's not always easy, it's not always fair,
The valuation game can be a nightmare.

When the founders are too greedy, too bold,
The investors may walk, the deal left cold.

But when they work together, with a common goal,
The valuation becomes a tool, not a toll.

To build something great, to change the world,
To be part of a journey that's yet to unfold.

The billion dollar idea, it's just a start,
To build a company, that's truly smart.

To hire the best, to change the game,
To build a culture, that's not the same.

The billion dollar idea, it's just a dream,
The real work starts, it's not what it seems.

But with perseverance, with grit and with grace,
The billion dollar idea, it's not a race.

It's a journey, that's full of ups and downs,
Of wins and losses, of smiles and frowns.

So let's not forget, what it's really about,
To build something great, to make an impact that's profound.

The billion dollar idea, it's just a number,
It's the mission, the purpose, that's the real thunder.

So let's go out there, and build something great,
A startup that's worthy, a team that's first-rate.

And when the valuation comes, we'll know what it means,
It's not about the number, it's about what it brings.
