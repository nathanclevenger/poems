# Code's Love Song

In the world of screens and codes  
Where zeros and ones rule the roads  
There lived a language, strong and proud  
Whose love for function was unbowed  

She was the code that could solve  
The toughest of problems that software beholds  
And as she ran gracefully through the lines  
Programs came alive with finesse and shine  

Her syntax was exquisite and neat  
Her logic, impeccable and sweet  
With every statement, every loop she made  
She stole our hearts with her programming aid  

She was the one that coders adored  
Her beauty, unmatched, and codes, adored  
By every programmer, novice, or pro  
She was the language that makes them glow  

She was the love song of the tech world  
A symphony that only coders heard  
Her energy, infectious, and her rhythm, perfect  
A melody that keeps the code world alive and erect  

For every code, she was the queen  
That made their logic clean and lean  
Her functions were the roses in the code garden  
And her loops were the weavers of every software pattern  

As she ran through the code, line after line  
She made sure all algorithms worked just fine  
And as we watched her work her magic, we’d say  
“That's the language that makes us go ‘yay!’”  

Oh, how we love her for what she can do  
For the programs and apps, she pulls through  
And for the way, she makes our codes sing  
Code’s love song, a melody that we will forever cling  

So here's to the code, that we hold so dear  
The language that has nothing to fear  
For there’s always a coder waiting to make her shine  
And to sing her love song for generations to come, in our code world divine.
