# On a Shoestring: A Poem on the Struggles of Bootstrapping Startups

On a shoestring we begin,
A dream we chase, a hope we win,
A passion that we cannot contain,
Fuel for the fire that fuels the flame.

With every penny we could save,
A gamble we’re willing to take,
To bring our vision to reality,
A startup born of our creativity.

Days spent in long hours,
Our minds in creative powers,
Nights spent in restless sleep,
Our souls longing for the leap.

On a shoestring we embark,
A journey wild, unfettered, and stark,
A path not taken by the faint of heart,
A winding road, a promising start.

Bootstrapping is not for the meek,
It’s pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and be fleet,
For every hurdle, a solution we seek,
For every stumble, we learn to get up and be sleek.

On a shoestring we try,
Our dreams, we hope to magnify,
Our products, services or ideas,
We hope to reach a massive empire.

Every setback we encounter,
We strive to learn and be better,
For every challenge, we adapt,
We never weary, never stop, never dread.

On a shoestring we thrive,
Our passion keeps our drive,
We move forward, we persevere,
Our success, one day, is sure to clear.

Hurdles abound, and we take them head-on,
Our shoestring investment carries us on,
With sheer grit and determination,
We persevere with the humblest vision.

Through good days, and even harder nights,
Our end goal, we kept inside,
To see the fruition of our toil,
Our creativity at a full boil.

We give it our all, our best, our might,
On a shoestring, our dream, a sight,
A startup born, that will take flight,
A day of success, that shines oh so bright.

And though the journey was not easy,
Our spirit was not always breezy,
We took the leap, on a shoestring,
And we made it to our startup kingdom.

On a shoestring, we begin,
And on a shoestring, we win,
For in our hearts, we know,
Our dream will continue to grow.
