# Colored by Code

Coding is an art, a brush with JSON paint
Each line is a stroke, with code as the faint
Our syntax the canvas, our compilers the paints
We choose our colors, debugging our restraints

The keystrokes are our instrument, our language is our song
Our function calls, a melody to sing along
We parse out the rhythm and loop it in time
Our code flows like music, then synced with each line

The colors of code, each value a hue
A painting of logic, a picture of truth
Each variable a brushstroke, defined with a name
Creating a world, with algorithms to tame

A world of arrays, with the colors they contain
From bold reds to calming blues, each value to maintain
We choose the shades, the syntax we write
Each stroke coming alive, as our code takes flight

The beauty of coding, beyond the lines we write
The colors we choose, the emotions in sight
The coding palette, a world to explore
Our syntax the key, unlocking a door

From HTML in gold, to CSS in green
Our world of coding, a painterly scene
With code as our brush, we create with ease
A symphony of colors, from which we compose and breathe

The code we write, colored with style
Our art of syntax, our legacy's trial
The logic we craft, a thing to admire
With colors we choose, our skills to inspire

So paint with your code, as you write it in sight
Choose colors with care, let them lead you in flight
Make sure each line, a brushstroke divine
Colored by code, a masterpiece shines.
