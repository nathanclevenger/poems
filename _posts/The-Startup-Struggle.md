# The Startup Struggle

It's a path less traveled, a road unexplored,
The journey of startup life, an endless reward.
A fire of passion, the spark of a dream,
To change the world, or so it seems.

The vision is clear, the goal in sight,
But the climb is steep, with no end in sight.
Days turn to weeks, weeks turn to months,
The startup struggle, the never-ending hunt.

The pressure mounts, stakes running high,
Money running out, only time can fly.
A team's bond tested, against insurmountable odds,
Magic can happen, or leave us scarred.

Hope is a driver, it keeps us going,
Perseverance is key, it keeps us rowing.
The startup struggle, a battlefield foe,
Victory is sweet, but the race is slow.

We take on risk, it's in our DNA,
Challenges are giant, but so too the payday.
Ideas bloom, innovation a must,
In the startup game, we forever trust.

With every failure comes another try,
Every hit is just a stepping stone to soar high.
The startup struggle is not for faint-hearted,
The bold, fearless, dogged is what is required.

The days are long, the nights even longer,
But our hunger to grow is only getting stronger.
From waking up at 4 am to work on the dream,
To the long marathon hours as the prize glimmers and gleam.

We live by the code, our own moral high-ground,
Of a life-changing impact all around.
The industry evolves, breakthroughs abundant,
But the constant shift, our hearts and minds to be resolute.

The startup struggle, the hustling and grinding,
Is a tale yet untold, yet ever so binding.
Success or bust, the name of the game,
In the startup struggle, we stake our claim.

For one fine day, the victory is won,
Ideas alive, progress in motion,
The countless struggles will lie bygone,
The startup life, a triumph never undone.
