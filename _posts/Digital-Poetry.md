# Digital Poetry

In zeroes and ones, a language unknown,
Where coding has become a verse on its own,
The wires connecting each digital part,
Creating a canvas for a poet's art.

The screen before us, the cursor's first blip,
A world to be crafted, with each line we script,
A limitless realm for our minds to roam,
A playground of creativity, our new home.

The blank page before us, a wide-open gate,
A world of potential, with each choice we make,
A place for expression, where the limits are blurred,
A place to share our creations, and be heard.

Here, digital art takes on a new form,
A blend of code and prose, a synthesis born,
An algorithmic sonnet, a script made of rhyme,
A world where digital poetry can shine.

Our fingers dance along the keys,
Crafting a work of beauty, with such ease,
As we navigate this digital land,
Our words become code, and our code becomes grand.

A function here, a loop over there,
A stanza crafted with the utmost care,
As we balance structure with creativity,
We create a digital world of such beauty.

Through syntax and structure, we weave our tale,
A blend of technology and prose, that never fails,
Our masterpieces created within a digital space,
Each keystroke adding meaning, to our artistic race.

Digital poetry is an art that's new,
A world of creation, where limits are few,
A place where coders become poets too,
And the lines between the two worlds, become askew.

As we navigate our digital creations,
We bring to life a world of innovation,
A world where computer language becomes art,
And digital poetry captures our heart.

In code we find beauty, for it brings to life,
A world of creation, free from strife,
A place to share ideas, and to inspire,
A realm where digital poetry takes fire.

So as we venture forth, into this digital realm,
May we find the beauty, in each digital helm,
In code we find artistry, in each digital space,
And may our digital poetry always find its rightful place.
