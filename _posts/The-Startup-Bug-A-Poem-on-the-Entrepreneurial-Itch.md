# The Startup Bug: A Poem on the Entrepreneurial Itch

The startup bug bites deep,
In the hearts of those who dare to dream,
To build something new, to disrupt,
And leave their mark on the world.

It starts with just an idea,
A spark that ignites a flame,
And soon enough, it becomes an obsession,
A passion that cannot be tamed.

The hours stretch on endlessly,
As they toil away on code and designs,
Perfecting their product, their baby,
And dreaming of funding rounds and signs.

They speak in acronyms and jargon,
To those who don't understand,
For they know their startup's secret sauce,
Their unique selling proposition, their brand.

The thrill of potential success,
Drives them on, through failure and defeat,
And though they know the risks,
They cannot resist the siren call, so sweet.

For those who catch the startup bug,
Life is never quite the same,
A constant road of ups and downs,
A never-ending game.

But oh, the rewards for those who win,
Are beyond measure or compare,
The satisfaction of seeing their vision,
Come to life, beyond all care.

The startup bug is not for everyone,
It requires dedication, passion, and grit,
But for those who are bitten deeply,
It's a journey that they'll never quit.

So here's to the entrepreneurs,
The ones who take the leap of faith,
For they are the ones who change the world,
And brighten up its darkest days.
