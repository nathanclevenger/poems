# Go Get 'Em: A Poem on the Art of Bootstrapping Hustle

It takes patience, grit, and heart,
To start a business from the start.
A little luck and a lot of hustle,
To turn an idea into a muscle.

The journey is tough, that is for sure,
But with determination, we can endure.
We bootstrap and grind day and night,
And turn our dreams into a sight.

We may face setbacks and obstacles as we start,
But we press on, with a strong heart.
We refuse to give up, for we know,
Success is just around the corner, we can show.

We cut down costs and we learn to improvise,
With creativity and innovation, we rise.
We focus on our strengths and we adapt,
We take the troubles and the difficulties, we untapp'd.

We take calculated risks and we take action,
We hustle and we grind with passion.
We never quit, we never stop,
We dream big, we soar high, we reach the top.

We build connections and we network,
We learn from others and we build on that work.
We are hungry, we are driven,
We make things happen, we are given.

We seize opportunities and we create our own,
With hard work, perseverance, we set the tone.
We build a legacy, one that'll last
We don't give up easily, we stick to our task.

When the going gets tough and life gets rough,
We seek inspiration, from others and from above.
We stay motivated and we keep going,
We won't let anything hold us down, we keep on growing.

For we know that the path to success,
Is not an easy one, it requires finesse.
But with patience and a never-ending hustle,
We can make it happen, we can bustle.

So go get 'em, startup founders, entrepreneurs and those alike.
With passion and determination, the future looks bright.
Keep grinding, keep hustling, for greatness is in store,
The sky's the limit, let's soar.
