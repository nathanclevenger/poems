# Hustle and Heart

In the world of startups, it takes more than just an idea,
To make it big and to succeed, you need some extra zeal.
A combination of hustle and heart, is what truly sets apart,
Those who make it to the top, from those who quickly depart.

The journey is not an easy one, it is often filled with storms,
But those who weather through it, find success in many forms.
There’s no shortcut to the top, no magic pill to swallow,
It’s all about hard work and persistence, every day to follow.

The hustle is what drives you, to work day and night,
To build a product that people love, that truly shines in sight.
It’s about taking risks, trying new things, learning from each mistake,
It’s about getting back up again, even when your spirit feels a bit shaken.

The heart is what keeps you going, when everything else falls apart,
It’s that inner voice that tells you, to keep pushing despite the scars.
It’s that unwavering belief in yourself, that you will succeed one day,
That spark of inspiration that motivates you, to keep grinding along the way.

The startup life is not for the faint-hearted, it’s a rollercoaster ride,
There’ll be highs and lows, moments of doubt, and some sleepless nights.
But if you have the hustle and heart, to follow your dreams with all your might,
You’ll emerge stronger, wiser, and victorious in your fight.

It’s not just about the money, the fame or the glory you’ll attain,
It’s about building something grand, that’ll make a difference in the chain.
It’s about creating something unique, that’ll last forevermore,
And leaving your mark on the world, something that’s truly worth living for.

So, to all you startup warriors, who seek to make a difference in the game,
Remember that hustle and heart, are what will earn you your fame.
Stay true to your vision, stay persistent even when it seems insane,
And one day you’ll realize, that all that hustle and heart, weren’t in vain.

So, cheers to the hustlers and the heart-driven, to the dreamers and makers,
The ones with a vision so grand, that it shakes and awakens,
The very foundations of our world, and inspires us all,
To have the hustle and heart, to chase our dreams, never to fall.
