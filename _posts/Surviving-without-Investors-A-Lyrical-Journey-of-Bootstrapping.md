# Surviving without Investors: A Lyrical Journey of Bootstrapping

In the world of startups,  
we all have a dream,  
to build something great,  
which will shine like a beam.  

We work hard day and night,  
to get our idea to the top,  
we envision success,  
and pray it won't stop.  

But the road to success,  
is often not so simple,  
and we are faced with challenges,  
that may make us tremble.  

Funding is one such challenge,  
which we often have to face,  
and without it, our startup,  
may lose its pace.  

But there is a way out,  
a path we can take,  
we can bootstrap our startup,  
and create our own fate.  

Bootstrapping is a journey,  
which is tough and hard,  
but it's the ultimate test,  
of the entrepreneur's card.  

For we have to be creative,  
to make our startup thrive,  
but in the end, we'll emerge,  
with victory in sight.  

We have to be frugal,  
and careful with every penny,  
we have to cut our costs,  
and make our business skinny.  

But this doesn't mean that we,  
have to compromise on quality,  
we can still make a great product,  
with passion and agility.  

We have to be scrappy,  
and think outside the box,  
we have to be resourceful,  
and not run out of stocks.  

We have to hustle,  
and work multiple roles,  
we have to be resilient,  
and never lose control.  

For bootstrapping is a journey,  
which requires hard work and grit,  
but the reward is great,  
and we'll look back with pride and wit.  

For we'll have built something,  
from scratch and with our own hands,  
we'll have survived without investors,  
and create our own brand.  

So let's embark on this journey,  
with passion and determination,  
let's bootstrap our startup,  
and create our own foundation.  

For we'll have survived,  
against all odds and fears,  
we'll have created a legacy,  
which will last for years and years.  

Bootstrapping is not for everyone,  
but for those who dare,  
it's a journey worth taking,  
to create something rare.  

So let's bootstrap our startups,  
with a vision and a dream,  
let's survive without investors,  
and achieve great things.
