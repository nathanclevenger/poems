# The Incubator Shuffle

In the world of startups,  
There's an incubator shuffle.  
Where ideas are pitched,  
And investors huddle.  

A place where dreams are made,  
And funding can be found.  
But with it comes pressure,  
And stress that's unbound.  

From early-stage to IPO,  
The road is long and rough.  
But with determination and grit,  
You can make it tough.  

You'll pivot and iterate,  
And revise your plan.  
You'll test your assumptions,  
And adjust your span.  

You'll have late nights and early mornings,  
Coffee-fueled and sleep-deprived.  
A constant cycle of building,  
And then seeing if it thrives.  

You'll embrace failure,  
And learn from your mistakes.  
You'll keep moving forward,  
No matter what it takes.  

As you navigate the journey,  
You'll make connections and friends.  
And you'll learn the value  
Of networking in the end.  

You'll hear countless pitches,  
And give advice when you can.  
You'll offer support and guidance,  
To your fellow startup clan.  

The incubator shuffle  
Can be daunting and intense.  
But for those with a passion,  
It's all just part of the dance.  

So keep your head up high,  
And your eyes on the prize.  
With each small victory,  
You'll realize your enterprise size.  

And in the end, when you succeed,  
You'll look back with a smile.  
At the journey you've taken,  
And the incubator shuffle in style.
