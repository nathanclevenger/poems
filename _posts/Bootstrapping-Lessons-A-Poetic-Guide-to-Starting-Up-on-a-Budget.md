# Bootstrapping Lessons: A Poetic Guide to Starting Up on a Budget

Starting up a business can be tough,
Especially when you don't have enough,
Enough cash to make your dreams come true,
But don't fret, there's plenty you can do.

You need to learn to bootstrap, my friend,
And make every penny count to the end.
Here are some lessons, in verse form,
To guide you through the start-up storm.

Lesson one: a budget is key,
To give you control and set you free.
Know your numbers before you begin,
And track them closely, let no penny win.

Lesson two: cut your costs,
But don't compromise on what you've lost.
Look for ways to save on every front,
Without sacrificing your business grunt.

Lesson three: do it yourself,
No need to hire help on every shelf.
Learn new skills with each passing day,
And you'll soon find your own way.

Lesson four: barter and trade,
To make sure your bills are paid.
Find mutual benefits with every deal,
And everyone will get their own steal.

Lesson five: embrace the lean,
And make it your business scene.
It's about being agile and fast,
And making what's needed to last.

Lesson six: make the most of free,
From social media to marketing glee.
Don't shy away from the power of word of mouth,
It's a tool that'll carry you to the South.

Lesson seven: network and thrive,
To keep your business alive.
Attend events and meet new folks,
And never forget to share your jokes.

Lesson eight: always keep learning,
It's the key to keep your business earning.
Embrace every opportunity you can,
And you'll reach the top of your business plan.

Starting up can be a difficult task,
But with these lessons, you'll have a flask,
Full of knowledge that'll take you far,
And reaching the top will be no bar.

Remember to bootstrap and stay true,
And your business dreams will come through.
Just keep working hard and never quit,
And success will come bit by bit.
