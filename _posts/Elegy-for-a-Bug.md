# Elegy for a Bug

Oh, little bug, what hast thou wrought
In the code that we so diligently sought
Thou, whose presence we oft abhor
Yet whose essence we can't ignore

Thou art a nuisance, a pest, a pain
In our program, thou doth leave a stain
Errors and glitches, a tangled mess
We curse thy existence, we must confess

But what of thy life, so small and brief
Didst thou struggle, or find relief
As thou crawled through the lines of code
Didst thou seek for an easier road

Didst thou dream, as thou didst roam
to leave this digital world, and find a new home
Perhaps in a garden, a leafy green place
Thou could live out thy days, with a bug's grace

But alas, those days were not to be
For thou didst cross paths, with our technology
And now we mourn, with this elegy
For thou hast left, this world we see

So we bid thee farewell, tiny bug
Though in truth, we wouldst rather smug
Without thee, our code wouldst be fine
But still we mourn, for we are not unkind

For in this world, even the smallest thing
Has a purpose, though it be fleeting
Though thy life was short, and fleeting too
In our code, thou hast left a residue

So farewell, our little bug
May thy journey, be gentle and snug
And though we may curse thy kind
In the grand scheme, thou art intertwined.
