# The Syntax Song

Come gather 'round, ye coders bold  
And heed my words, both young and old  
For I have a tale to tell  
Of syntax, our code's stony cell  

Syntax is the backbone  
Of every code we write  
It's the language that we speak  
In every program from day to night  

With curly brackets, semicolons too  
Our code is shaped, both through and through  
With indents, spaces, and line breaks  
Our code takes form, each and every shape  

Yet syntax is more than just symbols  
It's a language all its own  
With rules and structures that guide us  
To build software's towering throne  

For every code we write  
Has a syntax to follow  
And every language we use  
Has its own syntax to swallow  

From Java and Python to C++  
Syntax guides every line  
We must understand its nuances  
To write code divine  

So let us heed the rules of syntax  
And write code that's clear and true  
For with each line that we type  
We build the world anew  

And when our code runs error-free  
We'll rejoice in syntax's might  
For we know that it's our syntax  
That makes our code take flight  

So here's to syntax, our guiding star  
For with it, we can go far  
For in each line of code we write  
Syntax guides us to the light  

And though syntax may seem a chore  
It's the key to coding's door  
So let us sing its praises high  
For in syntax, we can truly fly.
