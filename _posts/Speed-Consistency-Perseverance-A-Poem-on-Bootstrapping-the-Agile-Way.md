# Speed, Consistency, Perseverance: A Poem on Bootstrapping the Agile Way

Speed, Consistency, Perseverance,
A trio that comes with immense significance,
In the world of startups and entrepreneurs,
Who want to build something with endurance.

Bootstrapping the agile way,
Is how they wish to pave their way,
With limited resources, yet bold ideas,
Their determination and hustle never fades.

Speed is the essence of the game,
For the startup world is not the same,
As the world of big corporates and giants,
Where things move slow and people are compliant.

It’s all about agility and being quick,
To refine, iterate and pivot till you click,
With a product that meets the needs of the market,
And has potential to scale, with strength to profit.

Consistency is also of utmost value,
To build credibility and trust with the few,
Who lend you their time, money and support,
As you tread an unconventional path, that’s hard.

Consistency in delivering your promises,
To your customers, your team and your premises,
Is a sign of your commitment and vision,
And how you intend to make a significant incision.

Perseverance keeps you going,
When the going gets tough, and the pace slows,
When there are challenges, and hurdles to cross,
And you feel like quitting, or lament a loss.

Perseverance is the strength of your soul,
That gives you the courage to take a bold role,
In creating something that was once a dream,
And now has the potential to change the scheme.

Bootstrapping the agile way is not easy,
For there are risks, uncertainties and fears that are greasy,
But with speed, consistency and perseverance,
You can overcome them, and emerge with resilience.

So dear entrepreneur, don’t give up your dream,
For it has the power, to make a difference, like a stream,
That flows with speed, consistency and perseverance,
And creates a world, that’s worth the reverence.
