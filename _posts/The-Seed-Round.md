# The Seed Round

The entrepreneur begins with a dream,
A vision burning bright,
A fire that sets their heart aglow
And fuels their daring flight.

They gather â€˜round them those who share
Their passion, vision, drive,
And work each day to bring to life
The plans and schemes that thrive.

They polish pitches, code with care,
And hone each budget line,
Each pivot brings them closer still
To where they hope to shine.

But every dream needs funds to grow,
To reach its full potential,
To wield its power and change the world
In ways that are quintessential.

And so they set out on a quest
To find investors bold,
Who see their vision, feel their spark,
And want to help unfold.

They navigate the maze of finance,
The maze of hopes and fears,
Each meeting, call, and demo held
With sweating palms and cheers.

They craft the perfect deck that shows
Their traction, team, and tech,
Their market research, cash burn rate,
And growth projections, spec.

They seek the funds to fuel their fire,
To bankroll their endeavor,
To fund the team, invest in growth,
And make it last forever.

This is the Seed Round, a time
Of early hopes and thrill,
Of brave ambitions, shared by few,
But held with steadfast will.

It's not for faint of heart, indeed,
The road ahead is tough,
With bumps and bruises guaranteed,
And times when they'll feel rough.

But those who make it to the end
Will reap the sweetest fruits,
Will grow their babies into stars,
And shine in living truth.

So here's to those who dare to dream,
To those who take the leap,
To those who launch and strive and build,
Without a pause, a peep.

May your Seed Round be blessed with luck,
With interests pure and fair,
May it grow strong and bear much fruit,
A legacy beyond compare.

May you change lives, make history,
And all your dreams come true,
May you stand proud, fulfilled and strong,
A testament to you.
