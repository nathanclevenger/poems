# Risk, Reward, Resilience: A Poem on the Ethics of Bootstrapping

In the world of startups, a path less traveled
A journey into uncharted waters unraveled
With risks that are high, and rewards that are few,
But the resilience to keep going is what will pull you through

Bootstrapping they call it, an adventure in itself
Turning a small idea into a booming wealth
With nothing but determination and some borrowed cash
Entrepreneurs set out to create a successful splash

The dawn of a new day brings with it a chance
To turn their dreams into reality with a nuance
Where what worked yesterday, may not work today
But the spirit to take risk, will show them the way

In this world of decision making, ethics play a key role,
Keeping yourself from questionable deeds and trolling.
Do not let hunger for success become unethical deeds,
As the right way to succeed is through ethical beliefs.

With every penny saved and every dollar invested
The entrepreneurs get closer to the day they've tested
Their idea, their model, their team and their will
To push through the challenges that seem impossible still

To amass a wealth of knowledge, experience and stress
Risking it all for the reward is not just success
It is the journey that takes them through the thick and thin
That tests their mettle and fortitude within.

Bootstrapping is not just about the money
It's a journey filled with lessons, both sweet and funny
The knowledge gained, the people met and learned
Are more precious than the cash that has been earned

It takes guts to start from nothing, to turn the tables
To keep the faith when everything else fails
To keep the torch burning when it seems too far
To hold on to your values, no matter how bizarre

The road ahead is filled with ups and downs
A rollercoaster ride without a crown
But it's the ride that matters in the end
The risk, the reward, the resilience to amend

Every startup is a phoenix, rising from its ashes
Shedding off the old, to embrace its new flashes
The journey is filled with sweat, blood and tears
But the result is worth it, that washes away all fears

At the end of it all, it's the resilience that matters
That keeps us pushing forward, our spirits will not shatter
For every success story, there are a million tales
Of those who tried and failed, but lived to tell their trail

The ethics of bootstrapping are not just a guide
They are the very soul of every startup that reside
In the hearts of the entrepreneurs, who dared to dream
To turn their ideas into reality, no matter how extreme

So, let's raise a toast to the ones who have tried
Who took a chance, and followed their stride
The dreamers, the doers, the risk-takers abound
Who, through their resilience, have left a story profound.
