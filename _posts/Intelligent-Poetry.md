# Intelligent Poetry

Syntax clean and precise  
A language spoken without lies  
A world of code, entirely nice  
Where the imagination thrives  

Structured data in perfect rows  
A landscape painted with symbols  
A programmer, his passion glows  
In the machine, he finds his hymnals  

A compiler, the orator of speech  
Translating the code into life  
A digital realm, forever in reach  
Where imagination cuts like a knife  

Integers and functions, algorithms too  
Variables and arrays, classes for days  
Coding is a place where dreams come true  
Endless possibilities, in countless arrays  

Brackets and semicolons, syntax that glows  
With a syntax highlighting, it moves and flows  
In the mind, imagination grows  
As the code becomes alive, and the passion grows  

A tool for intelligence, like none we’ve seen  
Ingenious minds, creating a world that gleams  
Landscapes of zeros and ones, an impossible dream  
A language for the ages, and so it seems  

In the machine, we find a kind of soul  
Coded by intelligent minds, with a noble goal  
Inspiration found, in a world that is whole  
The beauty of coding, an extraordinary role  

An art form with boundaries boundless,  
A world of creation with no limitations  
A place where the mind is flagless  
Freedom found, in its creations  

Code is the poetry of an intelligent age  
With its language and syntax, it fills a different page  
A world of logic, its mysteries unlocked  
Unveiling the beauty, in each and every block  

The code is the language of a world anew  
A place of creation, with skies of blue  
A world where imagination runs free  
And possibilities are boundless, just waiting to be  

Coding is a symphony, with melodies untold  
An art form of the future, with a story to unfold  
A world where the power of intelligence reigns  
And the beauty of the code, forever sustains  

So, let’s celebrate this poetry of intelligence  
A world of zeroes and ones, and logical relevance  
A symphony of code, with inspiration dense  
With a language like no other, to inspire and to commence.
