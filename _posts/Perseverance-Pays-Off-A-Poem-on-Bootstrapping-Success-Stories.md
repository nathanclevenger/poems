# Perseverance Pays Off: A Poem on Bootstrapping Success Stories

Bootstrapping is a hard task
Challenging, but one that we must grasp
Starting with limited funds
The journey is a bumpy one

Struggling every day and night
Trying to build and get it right
Passionate, we never give up
Believing in our dreams, we don't lose hope

Sometimes it feels like we're at our wit's end
But Perseverance is our dearest friend
We pick ourselves up and try again
Determined to succeed and make a name

With limited resources but boundless spirit
We forge ahead despite the limit
Every obstacle becomes an opportunity
To learn, adapt, and strengthen our capacity

Our goals may seem too far to reach
But our courage and tenacity always breach
The impossible, as we climb the summit
And prove that even without VC money, we can make it

We celebrate every milestone we achieve
Grateful for every support we receive
From our team, our customers, our community
Who believed in us and our ingenuity

Bootstrapping success stories we are
Inspiring others to reach for the stars
Perseverance pays off, we know it's true
And we hope this poem will inspire you too
