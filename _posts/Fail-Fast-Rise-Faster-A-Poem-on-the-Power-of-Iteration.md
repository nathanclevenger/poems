# Fail Fast, Rise Faster: A Poem on the Power of Iteration

Fail fast, rise faster,
A lesson for all to muster,
In the world of startups bold,
It's a mantra to behold.

Iteration is the key,
To success, it's clear to be,
Innovation breeds from tries,
And the power to improvise.

The idea to execute,
Is where many startups shoot,
But the willingness to try,
Is what sets winners aside.

The first step might be wrong,
But the courage to move along,
Makes the journey worthwhile,
And elevates the startup file.

When failure becomes the norm,
The path isn't lost yet, reform,
Reflect on the lesson it taught,
And then give a second-shot.

There is no shame in falling,
In fact, it's quite stimulating,
To learn and to grow,
And to see your startup glow.

Perfection is a myth,
Success takes persistence, grit,
Embrace the ups-and-downs,
And turn the setbacks around.

The triumph might come later,
But the journey is the savior,
Each try is an improvement,
Toward the startup's betterment.

Don't let the fear of failing,
Hold you back from sailing,
Head-on into the unknown,
Where greatness is usually sown.

Fail fast, rise faster,
A philosophy to muster,
In the world of startups bold,
It's a mantra to behold.
