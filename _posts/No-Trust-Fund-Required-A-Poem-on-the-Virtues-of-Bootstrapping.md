# No Trust Fund Required: A Poem on the Virtues of Bootstrapping

No trust fund required,
Just a dream and ambition,
Start with little but desire,
And bootstrap your way to fruition.

Forget the luxuries of life,
And sacrifices you must make,
With sweat and tears, your strife,
Your triumph will be at stake.

Funding is not your only goal,
For self-reliance is what you need,
With every obstacle and role,
Your persistence will then see.

There will be days so tough,
When the struggle seems unbearable,
But don't give up, stay rough,
And success will be attainable.

Bootstrapping is a game of hope,
Where dedication is key,
A journey that will help you cope,
And build your own destiny.

No trust fund required,
Just grit and perseverance,
With faith, your vision will be acquired,
And your future, your own existence.

So follow your heart and your passion,
And bootstrap your way to the top,
For with hard work and dedication,
You will never ever stop.

Forget the fancy cars and the big house,
For long-term goals are what you seek,
With your own sweat and your own vows,
Your future will be yours to keep.

No trust fund required,
Just a burning desire,
With effort, your plans will be wired,
And your goals, you will acquire.
