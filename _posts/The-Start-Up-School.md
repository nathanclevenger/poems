# The Start-Up School

In halls of learning, brick and stone  
Where once young minds had roamed alone  
A new kind of school has come to be  
One that fosters entrepreneurship, free.

The Start-Up School it is known  
From Silicon Valley to Rome  
A place where young minds can employ  
Their talents and creativity to enjoy.

In every corner, in every nook  
A startup idea you could never overlook  
From AI to Fintech, Cybersecurity and more  
Start-Up School is where you can explore.

A classroom filled with eager minds  
And mentors that can always find  
A way to help and guide you through  
The startup journey - a path anew.

Week after week, day by day  
You learn to think in a business way  
Of financial models, marketing trends  
And how to navigate uncertain bends.

But beyond just business acumen  
You learn to fail and try again  
For in the startup life, one thing is sure  
Obstacles must be faced and overcome for sure.

The art of resilience, grit and strength  
Are instilled in every student the length  
Of their time in Start-Up School  
To empower them to become an entrepreneur in full.

For in this modern world we live  
Startups have much to give  
The economy, society and more  
Benefit as they always explore.

Innovation, disruption and growth  
Are what sets startups apart from both  
The giants and the status quo  
That rule the world, we all know.

So, here's to the Start-Up School  
Where young minds shine like a jewel  
May their startup dreams come true  
And the world be a better place, anew.
